<p class='tp' style='font-size:1.2em;margin-bottom:20px;'>CHAPTER I</p>
<p class='tp' style='font-size:1em;margin-bottom:30px;'>THE CROW&#8217;S NEST</p>
<p>&#8220;You never told me how you happened
to name her Blythe.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two old friends, Mr. John DeWitt
and Mrs. Halliday, were reclining side by
side in their steamer-chairs, lulled into a
quiescent mood by the gentle, scarcely
perceptible, motion of the vessel. It was
an exertion to speak, and Mrs. Halliday
replied evasively, &#8220;Do you like the
name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For Blythe,&mdash;yes. But I don&#8217;t know
another girl who could carry it off so
well. Tell me how it happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Blythe&#8217;s mother reluctantly gathered
herself together for a serious effort,
and said: &#8220;It was the old Scotch nurse
who did it. She called her &#8216;a blythe lassie&#8217;
before she was three days old. We had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
been hesitating between Lucretia for
Charles&#8217;s mother and Hannah for mine,
and we compromised on Blythe!&#8221;</p>
<p>Upon which the speaker, allowing her
eyes to close definitively, took on the
appearance of gentle inanition which
characterised nine-tenths of her fellow-voyagers,
ranged side by side in their
steamer-chairs along the deck.</p>
<p>They had passed the Azores, that lovely
May morning, and were headed for Cape
St. Vincent,&mdash;the good old <i>Lorelei</i>
lounging along at her easiest gait, the
which is also her rapidest. For there is
nothing more deceptive than a steamer&#8217;s
behaviour on a calm day when the sea
offers no perceptible resistance to the
keel.</p>
<p>Here and there an insatiable novel-reader
held a paper-covered volume before
his nose, but more often the book had
slid to the deck, to be picked up by Gustav,
the prince of deck-stewards, and carefully
tucked in among the wraps of the
unconscious owner.</p>
<p>Just now, however, Gustav was enjoying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
a moment of unaccustomed respite
from activity, for his most exacting beneficiaries
were not sufficiently awake to
demand a service of him. He had administered
<i>bouillon</i> and lemonade and
cracked ice by the gallon; he had scattered
sandwiches and ginger cookies broadcast
among them; he had tenderly inquired of
the invalids, &#8220;&#8217;Ow you feel?&#8221; and had
cheerfully pronounced them, one and all,
to be &#8220;mush besser&#8221;; and now he himself
was, for a fleeting moment, the centre
of interest in the one tiny eddy of animation
on the whole length of the deck.</p>
<p>Just aft of the awning, in the full sunshine,
he was engaged in &#8220;posing,&#8221; with
the sheepish air of a person having his
photograph taken, while a fresh, comely
girl of sixteen stood, kodak in hand,
waiting for his attitude to relax. Half a
dozen spectators, elderly men and small
boys, stood about making facetious remarks,
but Gustav and his youthful &#8220;operator&#8221;
were too much in earnest to pay
them much heed.</p>
<p>Blythe Halliday was usually very much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
in earnest; by which is not to be inferred
that she was of an alarmingly serious cast
of mind. Her earnestness took the form
of intense satisfaction in the matter in
hand, whatever that might be, and she had
found life a succession of delightful experiences,
of which this one of an ocean voyage
was perhaps the most delectable of all.</p>
<p>In one particular Blythe totally disagreed
with her mother; for Mrs. Halliday
had declared, on one of the first
universally unbecoming days of the voyage,
that it was a mystery how all the
agreeable people got to Europe, since so
few of them were ever to be discovered
on an ocean steamer! Whereas Blythe,
for her part, had never dreamed that
there were so many interesting persons in
the world as were to be discovered among
their fellow-voyagers.</p>
<p>Was not the big, bluff Captain himself,
with his unfathomable sea-craft and his
autocratic power, a regular old Viking
such as you might read of in your history
books, but would hardly expect to meet
with in the flesh? And was there not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
a real Italian Count, elderly but impressive,
who had dealings with no one
but his valet, the latter being a nimble
personage with a wicked eye who seemed
to possess the faculty of starting up
through the deck as if summoned by a
species of wireless telegraphy? Best of
all, was not Blythe&#8217;s opposite neighbour
at the Captain&#8217;s table a shaggy, keen-eyed
Englishman, figuring on the passenger-list
as &#8220;Mr. Grey,&#8221; but who was
generally believed to be no less a personage
than Hugh Dalton, the famous poet,
travelling incognito?</p>
<p>This latter gentleman was more approachable
than the Count, and had taken
occasion to tell Blythe some very wonderful
tales, besides still further endearing
himself to her by listening with flattering
attention to such narratives as she
was pleased to relate for his benefit. Indeed,
they were rapidly becoming fast
friends and she was seriously contemplating
a snap-shot at his expense.</p>
<p>Mr. Grey, meanwhile, had joined the
group in the sunshine, where he stood,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
pipe in mouth, with his hands thrust
deep into the pockets of his reefer, regarding
Gustav&#8217;s awkwardness with kindly
amusement.</p>
<p>&#8220;There they go, those energetic young
persons!&#8221; Mr. De Witt observed, a few
minutes later, as Blythe and the Englishman
walked past, in search of the Captain,
whom Mr. Grey had suggested as the next
subject for photographic prowess. &#8220;Do
you suppose that really is Dalton?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. De Witt spoke with entire disregard
of the fact that Mrs. Halliday appeared
to be slumbering tranquilly. And
indeed an interrupted nap is so easily
made good on shipboard that Blythe
used sometimes to beg her mother to try
and &#8220;fall awake&#8221; for a minute!</p>
<p>On this occasion, as she walked past
with the alleged poet, she remarked:
&#8220;Even Mr. De Witt can&#8217;t keep Mamma
awake on shipboard, and she isn&#8217;t a bit
of a sleepy person on dry land.&#8221;</p>
<p>By way of response, Mr. Grey turned
to contemplate the line of steamer-chairs,
billowy with voluminous wraps, saying:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t the deck look like a sea becalmed?
See! Those are the waves,
too lazy to break!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How funny the ocean would look if
the waves forgot to turn over!&#8221; Blythe
exclaimed, glancing across the gently undulating
surface of the sea. &#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose
they&#8217;ve kept still one single instant
in millions of years!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not since the Spirit of God moved
upon the face of the waters,&#8221; her companion
returned, with quiet emphasis; and
Blythe felt surer than ever that he really
was the great poet whom people believed
him to be.</p>
<p>A moment later they had stormed the
bridge, where they two, of all the ship&#8217;s
company, were pretty sure of a welcome.
They found the Captain standing, with
his sextant at his eye, the four gold stripes
on his sleeve gleaming gaily in the sunshine.
Evidently things were going right,
for the visitors and their daring proposal
were most graciously received.</p>
<p>The fine old sea-dog stood like a man
to be shot at; and as Blythe faced him,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
kodak in hand, the breeze playing pranks
with her hair and blowing her golf-cape
straight back from her shoulders, it was
all so exhilarating that before she knew
it she had turned her little camera upon
the supposed Hugh Dalton himself, who
made an absurd grimace and told her to
&#8220;let her go!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was always a delightful experience
for Blythe to stand on the bridge and
watch the ship&#8217;s officers at their wonderful
work of guiding the great sea-monster
across the pathless deep. Here was the
brain of the ship, as Mr. Grey had once
pointed out, and to-day, when a sailor
suddenly appeared above the gangway
and, touching his hat, received a curt
order,&mdash;&#8220;That is one of the nerves of the
vessel,&#8221; her companion said. &#8220;It carries
the message of the brain to the furthest
parts of the body.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I suppose the eyes are up there,&#8221;
Blythe returned, glancing at the &#8220;crow&#8217;s
nest,&#8221; half-way up the great forward mast,
where the two lookouts were keeping
their steady watch.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he rejoined, &#8220;that must be why
they always have a pair of them,&mdash;so as
to get a proper focus. <i>Nicht wahr, Herr
Capit&auml;n?</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>And the little fiction was explained to
the Captain, who grew more genial than
ever under the stimulus of such agreeable
conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Ja wohl!</i>&#8221; he agreed, heartily; &#8220;<i>Ja
wohl!</i>&#8221;&mdash;which was really quite an outburst
of eloquence for Captain Seemann.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I couldn&#8217;t be captain,&#8221; Blythe announced,
&#8220;I think I should choose to be
lookout.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How is dat?&#8221; the Captain inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be the best place of all, away
up above everything and everybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you would like to go up dare?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I should!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you would not be afraid?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not I!&#8221;</p>
<p>Upon which the Captain, in high good-humour,
declared, &#8220;I belief you!&#8221;</p>
<p>After that he fell to speaking German
with Mr. Grey, and Blythe moved to the
end of the bridge, and stood looking down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
upon the steerage passengers, where they
were disporting themselves in the sun on
the lower deck.</p>
<p>They were a motley crew, and she never
tired of watching them, as they sat about
in picturesque groups, singing or playing
games, or lay stretched on the deck, fast
asleep.</p>
<p>Somewhat apart from the others was
a woman with a little girl whom Blythe
had not before observed. The child lay
on a bright shawl, her head against the
woman&#8217;s knee, her dark Italian eyes gazing
straight up into the luminous blue
of the sky. There was a curiously high-bred
look in the pale features, young and
unformed as they were, and Blythe wondered
how such a child as that came to
belong to the stout, middle-aged woman
who did not herself seem altogether out
of place in the rough steerage.</p>
<p>At this point in her meditations, a quiet,
matter-of-fact voice struck her ear, and,
turning, she found that Mr. Grey had
come up behind her.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Captain says he will have the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
&#8216;crow&#8217;s nest&#8217; lowered and let you go up in
it if you like,&#8221; was the startling announcement
which roused her from her revery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you are making fun!&#8221; she protested.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wonder you think so, but he
seems quite in earnest, and I can tell you
it&#8217;s the chance of a lifetime!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think it was!&#8221; she gasped.
&#8220;Oh, tell him he&#8217;s an angel with wings!
And please, <i>please</i> don&#8217;t let him change
his mind while I run and ask Mamma!&#8221;
With which Blythe vanished down the
gangway, her golf-cape rising straight up
around her head as the draught took it.</p>
<p>We may well believe that such a prospect
as that drove from her mind all
speculations as to the steerage passengers,
and that even the thought of the little
girl with the wonderful eyes did not again
visit her in the few hours intervening.</p>
<p>Yet when, that afternoon at eight-bells,
she passed with Mr. Grey down the steep
gangway to the steerage deck, which they
were obliged to traverse on their way to the
forecastle, and they came upon the little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
creature lying, with upturned face, against
the woman&#8217;s knee, Blythe felt a sharp
pang of compunction and pity. The child
looked even more pathetic than when seen
from above, and the young girl involuntarily
stooped in passing, and touched the
wan little cheek. Whereupon one of those
ineffable smiles which are the birthright
of Italians lighted the little face, and the
small hand was lifted with so captivating
a gesture that Blythe, clasping it in her
own, dropped on her knees beside the
child.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it your little girl?&#8221; she asked, looking
up into the face of the woman, whose
marked unlikeness to the child was answer
enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, Signorina,&#8221; the woman protested.
&#8220;She is my little Signorina.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you are taking her to Italy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Si, Signorina; alla bella Italia</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the lips of the little girl parted
with a still more radiant smile, and she
murmured, &#8220;<i>Alla bella Italia</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>A moment later, Blythe and her companion
had passed on and up to the forward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
deck where, climbing a short ladder
to the railing of the &#8220;crow&#8217;s nest,&#8221; they
dropped lightly down into this most novel
of elevators. There was a shrill whistle
from the boatswain, the waving of white
handkerchiefs where Mrs. Halliday and
Mr. DeWitt stood, forward of the wheel-house,
to watch the start; then the big
windlass began to turn, the rope was
&#8220;paid out,&#8221; and the slow, rather creaky
journey up the mast had begun.</p>
<p>It was a perfect day for the adventure.
The ship was not rolling at all, the little
motion to be felt being a gentle tilt from
stem to stern which manifested itself at
long intervals in the slightest imaginable
dip of the prow. And presently the ascent
was accomplished, and the &#8220;crow&#8217;s
nest&#8221; once more clung in its accustomed
place against the mast,&mdash;forty feet up in
the air, according to Mr. Grey&#8217;s reckoning.</p>
<p>As they looked across the great sea the
horizon seemed to have receded to an incalculable
distance, and the airs that came
to them across that broad expanse, unsullied
by the faintest trace of man or his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
works, were purer than are often vouchsafed
to mortals. Blythe felt her heart
grow big with the sense of space and
purity, and this wonderful swift passage
through the upper air. Involuntarily she
took off her hat to get the full sweep of
the breeze upon her forehead.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a new sound reached her
ear,&mdash;a small, remote, confidential kind of
voice, that seemed to arrive from nowhere
in particular.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the Captain, hailing us through
his megaphone,&#8221; her companion remarked;
and, glancing down, far down,
in the direction of the bridge, Blythe beheld
the Captain, looking curiously attenuated
in the unusual perspective, standing
with a gigantic object resembling a cornucopia
raised to his lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;You like it vare you are?&#8221; quoth the
uncanny voice, not loud, but startlingly
near.</p>
<p>And Blythe nodded her head and
waved her hat in vigorous assent.</p>
<p>The great ship stretched long and narrow
astern, the main deck shut in with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
awnings through which the huge smokestacks
rose, and the wide-mouthed ventilators
crooked their necks. Along either
outer edge of the awnings a line of lifeboats
showed, tied fast in their high-springing
davits, while from the mouth of
the yellow ship&#8217;s-funnels black masses of
smoke floated slowly and heavily astern.
The <i>Lorelei</i> swam the water like a wonderful
white aquatic bird, leaving upon the
quiet sea a long snowy track of foam.</p>
<p>On a line with their lofty perch a sailor
swung spider-like among the network of
sheets and halyards that clung about
the mainmast, its meshes clearly defined
against the pure blue of the sky, while below
there, on the bridge, the big brass
nautical instruments gleamed, and the
caps of the Captain and his lieutenants
showed white in the sun. As Blythe
glanced down and away from this stirring
outlook, she could just distinguish among
the dark figures of the steerage the small
white face of the child upturned toward
the sky; and again a sharp pang took her,
a feeling that the little creature did not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
belong among those rough men and
women. No wonder that the beautiful
Italian eyes always sought the sky; it
was their only refuge from sordid sights.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose the woman meant that the
child was her little mistress; did she
not?&#8221; Blythe asked abruptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was what I understood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s probably a romance; don&#8217;t you
think so?&#8221; and Blythe felt that she was
applying to a high authority for information
on such a head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like it,&#8221; the great authority
opined. &#8220;I think we shall have to investigate
the case.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, will you? And you speak Italian
so beautifully!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m sure of it! It sounds so
exactly like the hand-organ men!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Miss Blythe,&#8221; the poet protested,
&#8220;you must not flatter a modest
man like that. My daughter would say
you were turning my head.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I rather think your daughter
knows that it&#8217;s not the kind of head to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
be turned,&#8221; Blythe answered easily. She
was beginning to feel as if she had known
this famous personage all her life.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall tell her that,&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>Presently one-bell sounded a faint tinkle
far below, and the big megaphone inquired
whether they wanted to come down,
and was assured that they did not. And
all the while during their voyage through
the air, which was prolonged for another
half-hour, the two good comrades were
weaving romances about the little girl;
and with a curious confidence, as if, forsooth,
they could conjure up what fortunes
they would out of that vast horizon toward
which the good ship was bearing them
on.</p>
<p>At last the time came for them to go
below, and they reluctantly signalled to
the sailors, grouped about the deck in
patient expectation. Upon which the
windlass was set going, and slowly and
creakingly the &#8220;crow&#8217;s nest&#8221; was lowered
from its airy height.</p>
<p>The two a&euml;ronauts found the steerage
still populous with queer figures, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
atmosphere seemed more unsavoury than
ever after their sojourn among the upper
airs. To their disappointment, however,
the woman and her Signorina were nowhere
to be seen. Blythe and Mr. Grey
looked for them in every corner of the
deck, but no trace of them was to be
found, and Blythe mounted the gangway
to their own deck with much of the reluctance
which she often felt in submitting to
an interruption in a serial story.</p>
<p>They found Mrs. Halliday amusing herself
with a glass of cracked ice, giving
casual attention the while to a very long
story told by a garrulous fellow-passenger
in a wadded hood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mamma,&#8221; Blythe cried, perching
upon the extension foot of her mother&#8217;s
chair, &#8220;why didn&#8217;t you and Mr. DeWitt
stay longer? And how did it happen that
nobody else got wind of it? I don&#8217;t believe
a single person knows what we&#8217;ve
been about! And oh! we have had such
a glorious time! It was like being a bird!
Only that little girl in the steerage oughtn&#8217;t
to be there, and Mr. Grey and I are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
going to see what can be done about it,
and&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>The wadded hood had fallen silent, and
now its wearer rose, with an air of resignation,
and carried her tale to another listener,
while Mr. Grey also moved away,
leaving Blythe to tell her own story.</p>
<p>They were great friends, Mrs. Halliday
and this only child of hers, and well they
might be; for, as Blythe had informed
Mr. Grey early in their acquaintance;
&#8220;Mamma and I are all there are of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>As she sat beside this best of friends,&mdash;having
dropped into the chair left vacant
by the wadded hood,&mdash;Blythe lived over
again every experience and sensation of
that eventful afternoon, and with the delightful
sense of sharing it with somebody
who understood. And, since the most
abiding impression of all had been her
solicitude for the little steerage passenger,
she found no difficulty in arousing her
mother to an almost equal interest in the
child&#8217;s fate.</p>
<p>And presently, when the cornet player
passed them, with the air of short-lived
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
importance which comes to a ship&#8217;s cornet
three times a day, and, stationing himself
well aft, played the cheerful little tune
which heralds the approaching dinner-hour,
Blythe slipped her hand into her
mother&#8217;s and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll do something about that little
girl; won&#8217;t us, Mumsey?&#8221;</p>
<p>Upon which Mrs. Halliday, rising, and
patting the rosy cheek which she used to
call the &#8220;apple of her eye,&#8221; said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t wonder if us did, Blythe.&#8221;</p>

<p class='tp' style='font-size:1.2em;margin-bottom:20px;'>CHAPTER II</p>
<p class='tp' style='font-size:1em;margin-bottom:30px;'>THE LITTLE SIGNORINA</p>
<p>Blythe lay awake a long time that
night, thinking, not of the bridge nor
of the &#8220;crow&#8217;s nest,&#8221; not of the Captain
nor of the supposed Hugh Dalton, but of
the child in the steerage. How stifling it
must be down there to-night! It was
hot and airless enough here, where Blythe
had a stateroom to herself,&mdash;separated
from her mother&#8217;s by a narrow passageway,
and where the port-holes had been
open all day. Now, to be sure, they were
closed; for the sea was rising, and already
the spray dashed against the thick glass.
Oh, how must it be in the steerage! And
how did it happen that that nice woman
had been obliged to take her little Signorina
in such squalid fashion to <i>la bella
Italia</i>?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></p>
<p>Blythe fell asleep with the sound of
creaking timbers in her ears, as the good
ship strained against the rising sea, and
when the clear note of the cornet, playing
the morning hymn, roused her from her
dreams, the roaring of wind and waves
sent her thoughts with a shock of pity to
the little steerage passenger shut up below.
For with such a sea as this the waves
must be sweeping the lower deck, and
there could be no release for the poor
little prisoner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Vhy you not report that veather from
the lookout?&#8221; the Captain asked with
mock severity as Blythe appeared at the
breakfast table.</p>
<p>The racks were on, and the knives and
forks had begun their time-honoured minuet
within their funny little fences. The
amateur &#8220;lookout&#8221; glanced across the
table at her friend and ally the poet, who
nodded encouragingly as she answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we knew the Captain knew all
about it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think de Capit&auml;n know pretty
much eferything, <i>wie es scheint</i>!&#8221; was the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
reply, uttered in so deep a guttural that
Blythe knew the old Viking did not take
very seriously the &#8220;bit of weather&#8221; that
seemed to her so violent. In fact, he
owned as much before he had finished his
second cup of coffee.</p>
<p>Yet when she came up the companionway
after breakfast, she found a stout rope
stretched across the deck from stanchion
to stanchion to hold on by, the steamer
chairs all tied fast to the rail that runs
around the deckhouse, and every preparation
made for rough weather.</p>
<p>It was not what a sailor would have
called a storm, but the sea was changed
enough from the smiling calm of yesterday.
Not many passengers were on
deck, half a dozen, only, reclining in their
chairs in the lee of the deckhouse, close
reefed in their heavy wraps; while here
and there a pair of indefatigable promenaders
lurched and slid along the heaving
deck arm in arm, or clung to any chance
support in a desperate effort to keep their
footing.</p>
<p>Blythe had to buffet her way lustily as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
she turned a corner to windward. Holding
her golf-cape close about her and jamming
her felt hat well down on her head,
she made her way to the narrow passageway
forward of the wheel-house where one
looks down into the steerage. The waves
were dashing across the deck, which was
deserted excepting for one or two dark-browed
men crouched under shelter of
the forecastle.</p>
<p>There was a light, drizzling rain, and
now and then the spray struck against her
face. Blythe looked up at the &#8220;crow&#8217;s
nest,&#8221; which was describing strange geometrical
figures against the sky. The
lookouts in their oil-coats did not seem in
the least to mind their erratic passage
through space. She wished it were eight-bells
and time for them to change watch;
it was always such fun to see them running
up the ladder, hand over hand, their
quick, monkey-like figures silhouetted
against the sky.</p>
<p>How nobly the great ship forged ahead
against an angry sea, climbing now to the
crest of a big wave, and giving a long,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
shuddering shake of determination before
plunging down into a black, swirling hollow!
And how the wind and the waters
bellowed together!</p>
<p>The Captain was on the bridge in his
rubber coat and sou&#8217;-wester. He had said
this would not last long, and he had
stopped for a second cup of coffee before
leaving the table. All the same, Blythe
would not have ventured to accost him
now, even if he had passed her way.</p>
<p>Presently she returned under shelter of
the awning and let Gustav tuck her up in
her chair to dry off. And Mr. DeWitt
came and sat down beside her and instructed
her in the delectable game of
&#8220;Buried Cities,&#8221; in which she became
speedily so proficient that, taking her cue
from the lettering on one of the lifeboats,
she discovered the city of Bremen lying
&#8220;buried&#8221; in &#8220;the som<i>bre men</i>ace of the
sea!&#8221;</p>
<p>After a while, Gustav appeared before
them, bearing a huge tray of <i>bouillon</i>
and sandwiches, with which he was striking
the most eccentric angles; and Blythe
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
discovered that she was preposterously
hungry. And while her nose was still
buried in her cup, she espied over its rim
a pair of legs planted well apart, in the
cause of equilibrium, and the big, pleasant
voice of Mr. Grey made itself heard above
wind and sea, saying, &#8220;Guess where I&#8217;ve
been.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the smoking-room,&#8221; was the prompt
reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On the bridge,&mdash;only you wouldn&#8217;t
dare!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Once more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I know,&#8221; Blythe cried, setting her
thick cup down on the deck, and tumbling
off her chair in a snarl of steamer-rugs;
&#8220;You&#8217;ve been down in the steerage finding
out about the little Signorina!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who told you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did! You looked so pleased with
yourself! Oh, do tell me all about her!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve had a long talk with the
woman. Shall we walk up and down?&#8221;</p>
<p>And off they went, with that absence
of ceremony which characterises life on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
shipboard, leaving Mr. DeWitt to bury
his cities all unaided and unapplauded.
Then, as the two walked up and down,&mdash;literally
up and down, for the ship was
pitching a bit, and sometimes they were
labouring up-hill, and sometimes they
were running down a steep incline,&mdash;as
they walked up and down Mr. Grey told
his story.</p>
<p>The woman, Giuditta, had confided to
him all she knew, and he had surmised
more. Giuditta had known the family
only since the time, three years ago,
when she had been called in to take care
of the little Cecilia during the illness of
the Signora. The father had been a
handsome good-for-nothing, who had got
shot in a street row in that quarter of
New York known as &#8220;Little Italy.&#8221; He
was nothing,&mdash;<i>niente</i>, <i>niente</i>;&mdash;but the
Signora! Oh, if the gentleman could but
have known the Signora, so beautiful, so
patient, so sad! Giuditta had stayed with
her and shared her fortunes, which were
all, alas! misfortunes,&mdash;and had nursed
her through a long decline. But never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
a word had she told of her own origin,&mdash;the
beautiful Signora,&mdash;nor had her
father&#8217;s name ever passed her lips. Had
she known that she was dying, perhaps
then, for the child&#8217;s sake, she might have
forgotten her pride. But she was always
thinking she should get well,&mdash;and then,
one day, she died!</p>
<p>There was very little left,&mdash;only a few
dollars; but among the squalid properties
of the pitiful little stage where the poor
young thing had enacted the last act of
her tragedy, was one picture, a <i>Madonna</i>,
with the painter&#8217;s name, G. Bellini, just
decipherable. It was a little picture,
twelve inches by sixteen, in a dingy old
frame, and not a pretty picture at
that. But a kind man, a dealer in antiquities,
had given Giuditta one hundred
dollars for it. &#8220;Think of that, Signore!
One hundred dollars for an ugly little
black picture no bigger than that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; Mr. Grey remarked, as
they stood balancing themselves at an
angle of many degrees,&mdash;&#8220;I suppose that
the picture was genuine,&mdash;else the man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
would hardly have paid one hundred
dollars for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And would it be worth more than
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A trifle,&#8221; he replied, rather grimly.
&#8220;Somewhere among the thousands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why should they have kept such
a picture when they were so poor? Why
didn&#8217;t they sell it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That would hardly have occurred to
them. It was evidently a family heirloom
that the girl had taken with her because
she loved it. I doubt if she guessed its
value. A Bellini! A Giovanni Bellini,
in a New York tenement house! Think
of it! And now I suppose some millionaire
has got it. Likely enough somebody
who doesn&#8217;t know enough to buy
his own pictures! Horrible idea! Horrible!&#8221;
and Mr. Grey strode along, all but
snorting with rage at the thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;But tell me more about the little
girl,&#8221; Blythe entreated, wishing the wind
wouldn&#8217;t blow her words out of her
mouth so rudely. &#8220;Her name is Cecilia,
you say?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; Cecilia. Dopo is the name they
went by, but the nurse doesn&#8217;t think it
genuine. Her idea is that her Signora
was the daughter of some great family,
and got herself disowned by marrying
an opera singer who subsequently made
a fiasco and dropped his name with
his fame. She doesn&#8217;t think Dopo ever
was a family name. It means &#8216;after,&#8217; you
know, and they may have adopted it for
its ironical significance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the poor lady died and never
told!&#8221; Blythe panted, as they toiled painfully
up-hill with the rain beating in their
faces.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and&mdash;look out! hold tight!&#8221; for
suddenly the slant of the deck was reversed,
and they came coasting down to
an impromptu seat on a bench.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems,&#8221; Mr. Grey went on, when
they had resumed their somewhat arduous
promenade,&mdash;&#8220;it seems the woman, Giuditta,
is quite alone in the world and has
been longing to get back to Italy. So
she easily persuaded herself that she could
find the child&#8217;s family and establish her in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
high life. Giuditta has an uncommonly
high idea of high life,&#8221; he added. &#8220;I
think she imagines that somebody in a
court train and a coronet will come to
meet her Signorina at the pier in Genoa.
Poor things! There&#8217;ll be a rude awakening!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we won&#8217;t let it be rude!&#8221; Blythe
protested. &#8220;We must do something about
it. Can&#8217;t you think of anything to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>They were standing now, clinging to
the friendly rope stretched across the
deck, shoulder high.</p>
<p>&#8220;Giuditta&#8217;s plan,&#8221; Mr. Grey replied,
&#8220;is the na&iuml;ve one of appealing to the
Queen about it. And, seriously, I think
it may be worth while to ask the American
Minister to make inquiries. For there
is, of course, a bare chance that the family
may be known at Court. In the meantime&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the meantime,&#8221; Blythe interposed,
&#8220;we&#8217;ve got to get her out of the steerage!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mamma will arrange that. We&#8217;ll
just make a cabin passenger of her, and I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
can take her in with me in my stateroom.
Oh! how happy she will be, lying in my
steamer chair, with that dear Gustav to
wait on her! I must go down at once
and get Mamma to say yes!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you think she will?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know she will! She is always doing
nice things. If you really knew her you
wouldn&#8217;t doubt it!&#8221; And with that the
young optimist vanished in her accustomed
whirl of golf-cape.</p>
<p>If faith can move mountains, it is perhaps
no wonder that the implicit and energetic
faith of which Blythe Halliday was
possessed proved equal to the removal of
a small child from one quarter to another
of the big ship. The three persons concerned
in bringing about the change were
easily won over; for Mrs. Halliday was
quite of Blythe&#8217;s mind in the matter, Mr.
Grey had little difficulty in bringing the
Captain to their point of view, while, as
for Giuditta, she hailed the event as the
first step in the transformation of her
small Signorina into the little &#8220;great
lady&#8221; she was born to be.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span></p>
<p>Accordingly, close upon luncheon time,
when the sun was just breaking through
the clouds, and the sea, true to the Captain&#8217;s
prediction, was already beginning to
subside, the tiny Signorina was carried, in
the strong arms of Gustav, up the steep
gangway by the wheel-house, where Blythe
and her mother, Mr. DeWitt and the poet,
to say nothing of Captain Seemann himself,
formed an impromptu reception committee
for her little ladyship.</p>
<p>As the child was set on her feet at the
head of the gangway, she turned to throw
a kiss down upon her faithful Giuditta,
and then, without the slightest hesitation,
she placed her hand in Blythe&#8217;s, and
walked away with her.</p>
<p>That evening there was a dance on
board the <i>Lorelei</i>; for it had been but the
fringe of a storm which they had crossed,
and the sea was again taking on its long,
easy swell.</p>
<p>The deck presented a festal appearance
for the occasion. Rows of Japanese lanterns
were strung from side to side against
the white background of awning and deckhouse,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
and the flags of many nations lent
their gay colours to the pretty scene. The
ship&#8217;s orchestra was in its element, playing
with a &#8220;go&#8221; and rhythm which seemed
caught from the pulsing movement of the
ship itself.</p>
<p>As Blythe, with Mr. DeWitt, who had
been a famous dancer in his day, led off
the Virginia Reel, she wondered how it
would strike the sailors of a passing brig,&mdash;this
gay apparition of light and music,
riding the great, dark, solemn sea.</p>
<p>The dance itself was rather a staid,
middle-aged affair, for Blythe was the only
young girl on board, and none but the
youngest or the surest-footed could put
much spirit into a dance where the law of
gravitation was apparently changing base
from moment to moment. Blythe and
her partner, however, took little account
of the moving floor beneath their feet, or
the hesitating demeanour of their companions.
One after another, even the most
reluctant and self-distrustful of the revellers
found themselves caught up into active
participation in the figure.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></p>
<p>In a quiet corner of the deck sat Mrs.
Halliday, with little Cecilia beside her,
snugly stowed away in a nest of steamer-rugs;
for they could not bear to take her
below, out of the fresh, invigorating air.
Their little guest spoke hardly any English,
but, although Mrs. Halliday was under the
impression that she herself spoke Italian,
the child seemed more conversable in
Blythe&#8217;s company than in that of any one
else, not excepting Mr. Grey, about whose
linguistic accomplishments there could be
no question.</p>
<p>Accordingly when, the Virginia Reel
being finished, Blythe came and sat on the
foot of the little girl&#8217;s chair, they fell into
an animated conversation, each in her own
tongue. And presently, during a pause
in the music, the Italian Count chanced to
pass their way, and, stopping in his solitary
promenade, appeared to give ear to their
talk.</p>
<p>Suddenly he stooped, and, looking into
the animated face of the child, inquired
in his own tongue; &#8220;What is thy name,
little one?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></p>
<p>But when the pure, liquid, childish voice
answered &#8220;Cecilia Dopo,&#8221; he merely lifted
his hat and, bowing ceremoniously, passed
on.</p>
<p>Mr. Grey, who had watched the little
scene from a distance, joined the group
a moment later and, taking a vacant chair
beside Mrs. Halliday, remarked:</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we shall have to cultivate the
old gentleman. He might be induced to
lend a hand in behalf of this young person.
They are both Florentines,&#8221; he added,
thoughtfully, &#8220;and Florentine society is
not large.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you really believe the nurse is
right about the child?&#8221; Mrs. Halliday
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I shouldn&#8217;t dare say that the
mother was a great lady,&#8221; he returned;
&#8220;but there is certainly something high-bred
about the little thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They often have that air,&#8221; Mrs.
Halliday demurred,&mdash;&#8220;even the beggar
children.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; to our eyes. But, do you know,
I rather think the Italians themselves can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
tell the difference. I would rather trust
Giuditta&#8217;s judgment than my own. Besides,&#8221;
he added, after a long pause, during
which he had been watching the
expressive face of the child. &#8220;Besides,&mdash;there&#8217;s
that Giovanni Bellini. That sort
of thing doesn&#8217;t often stray into low
society.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this juncture the tall Italian moved
again into their neighbourhood, and stood,
at a point where the awning had been
drawn back, gazing, with a preoccupied
air, out to sea.</p>
<p>Rising from his seat, Mr. Grey approached
him, remarking abruptly, and
with a jerk of the head toward Cecilia,
&#8220;Florentine, is she not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Sicuro</i>,&#8221; was the grave reply; upon
which the Count moved away, to be seen
no more that evening.</p>
<p>As the Englishman rejoined them after
this laconic interview, Blythe greeted him
with a new theory.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I used to
think the Count was haughty and disagreeable,
but I have changed my mind.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That only shows how susceptible you
good Republicans are to any sign of attention
from the nobility,&#8221; was the teasing
reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you are right,&#8221; Blythe returned,
with the fair-mindedness which
distinguished her. &#8220;You know I never
saw a titled person before, excepting one
red-headed English Lord, who hadn&#8217;t any
manners. I&#8217;ve often thought I should
like, of all things, to know a King or
Queen really well!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say so!&#8221; Mr. Grey laughed.
&#8220;And what&#8217;s your opinion now, of the
old gentleman, since he deigned to interrupt
your conversation?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe he is unhappy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes you think so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s an unhappy look away back
in his eyes. I never looked in before,&mdash;and
then&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And then&#8211;&#8211;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something about his voice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; Tuscan, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, is that it? Well, any way, I like
him!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s the case, perhaps you could
make better headway with him than I.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t speak Italian.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you speak French.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know my conjugations,&#8221; was the
modest admission.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m sure he would be enchanted
to hear them,&#8221; Mr. Grey laughed, as the
orchestra struck into the familiar music of
the Lancers, causing him to beat a retreat
into the smoking-room.</p>
<p>And while Blythe danced gaily and heartily
with a boy somewhat younger than
herself, and not quite as tall, her little prot&eacute;g&eacute;e
fell into a deep sleep. And presently,
the dance being over, the faithful Gustav
carried her down to Blythe&#8217;s stateroom,
where she was snugly tucked away in the
gently rocking cradle of the lower berth.</p>
<p>As for Blythe, thus relegated to the
upper berth, she entered promptly into
an agreeable dreamland, where she found
herself speaking Italian fluently, and where
she discovered, to her extreme satisfaction,
that the Queen of Italy was her bosom
friend!</p>

<p class='tp' style='font-size:1.2em;margin-bottom:20px;'>CHAPTER III</p>
<p class='tp' style='font-size:1em;margin-bottom:30px;'>A NEW DAWN</p>
<p>It was pretty to see the little Signorina
revive under the favouring influences
of prosperity; and indeed the soft airs of
the southern seas were never sweeter nor
more caressing than those which came to
console our voyagers for their short-lived
storm.</p>
<p>Life was full of interest and excitement
for the little girl. The heavy lassitude
of her steerage days had fallen from her,
and already that first morning a delicate
glow of returning vigour touched
the little cheek.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s picking up, isn&#8217;t she?&#8221; Mr.
DeWitt remarked, as he joined Blythe and
the child at the head of the steerage gangway,
where the little one was throwing
enthusiastic kisses and musical Italian
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
phrases down upon the hardly less radiant
Giuditta.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes!&#8221; was the confident reply.
&#8220;She&#8217;s a different child since her saltwater
bath and her big bowl of oatmeal.
Mamma says she really has a splendid
physique, only she was smothering down
there in the steerage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Mr. DeWitt stooped and, lifting
the child, set her on the railing, where
she could get a better view of her faithful
friend below.</p>
<p>&#8220;There! How do you like that?&#8221; he
inquired.</p>
<p>Upon which the little girl, finding herself
unexpectedly on a level with Blythe&#8217;s
face, put up her tiny hand and stroked
her cheek.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like-a Signorina,&#8221; she remarked with
apparent irrelevance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! You do, do you? Well, she&#8217;s
a nice girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nice-a girl-a,&#8221; the child repeated, adding
a vowel, Italian fashion, to each word.</p>
<p>Then, with an appreciative look into
the pleasant, whiskered countenance,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
whose owner was holding her so securely
on her precarious perch, she pressed her
little hand gently against his waistcoat,
and gravely remarked, &#8220;Nice-a girl-a,
<i>anche il Signore</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So! I&#8217;m a nice girl too, am I?&#8221; the
old gentleman replied, much elated with
the compliment.</p>
<p>And Giuditta, down below, perceiving
that her Signorina was making new conquests,
snatched her bright handkerchief
from her head, and waved it gaily; whereupon
a score of the steerage passengers,
seized with her enthusiasm, waved their
hats and handkerchiefs and shouted;
&#8220;<i>Buon&#8217; viaggio, Signorina! Buon&#8217;
viaggio</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>And the little recipient of this ovation
became so excited that she almost
jumped out of the detaining arms of Mr.
DeWitt, who, being of a cautious disposition,
made haste to set her down again;
upon which they all walked aft, under the
big awning.</p>
<p>&#8220;She makes friends easily,&#8221; Mr. Grey
remarked, later in the morning, as he and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
Blythe paused a moment in their game of
ring-toss. The child was standing, clinging
to the hand of a tall woman in black,
a grave, silent Southerner who had hitherto
kept quite to herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Blythe rejoined, &#8220;but she is
fastidious. She will listen to no blandishments
from any one whom she doesn&#8217;t
take a fancy to. That good-natured,
talkative Mr. Distel has been trying all
day to get her to come to him, but she always
gives him the slip.&#8221; And Blythe, in
her preoccupation, proceeded to throw
two rings out of three wide of the
mark.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has the Count taken any more notice
of her?&#8221; Mr. Grey inquired, deftly
tossing the smallest of all the rings over
the top of the post.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apparently not; but she takes a great
deal of notice of him. See, she&#8217;s watching
him now. I should not be a bit surprised
if she were to speak to him of her
own accord one of these days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are not many days left,&#8221; her
companion remarked. &#8220;The Captain says
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
we shall make Cape St. Vincent before
night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, how fast the voyage is going!&#8221;
Blythe sighed.</p>
<p>Yet, sorry as she would be to have the
voyage over, no one was more enchanted
than Blythe when Cape St. Vincent rose
out of the sea, marking the end of the
Atlantic passage. It was just at sundown,
and the beautiful headland, bathed
in a golden light, stood, like the mystic
battlements of a veritable &#8220;Castle in
Spain,&#8221; against a luminous sky.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mamma,&#8221; Blythe asked, &#8220;did you ever
see anything more beautiful than that?&#8221;</p>
<p>They were standing at the port railing,
with the little girl between them, watching
the great cliffs across the deep blue sea.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing more beautiful than that
seen through your eyes, Blythe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you do see it through my
eyes, Mumsey,&#8221; Blythe answered, thoughtfully,
&#8220;just as I am getting to see things
through Cecilia&#8217;s eyes. I never realised
before how things open up when you look
at them that way.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>And Mrs. Halliday smiled a quiet, inward
smile that Blythe understood with a
new understanding.</p>
<p>They took little Cecilia ashore with
them at Gibraltar the next morning, and
again Blythe experienced the truth of her
new theory.</p>
<p>It was our heroine&#8217;s first glimpse of
Europe, and no delectable detail of their
hour&#8217;s drive, no exotic bloom, no strange
Moorish costume, no enchanting vista of
cliff or sea, was lost upon her. Yet she
felt that even her enthusiasm paled before
the deep, speechless ecstasy of the little
Cecilia. It was as if, in the tropical glow
and fragrant warmth, the child were
breathing her native air,&mdash;as if she had
come to her own.</p>
<p>On their return, as the grimy old tug
which had carried them across the harbour
came alongside the big steamer,
the child suddenly exclaimed, &#8220;<i>Ecco, il
Signore!</i>&#8221; and, following the direction of
her gesture, their eyes met those of the
Count looking down upon them. He instantly
moved away, and they had soon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
forgotten him, in the pleasurable excitement
of bestowing upon Giuditta the
huge, hat-shaped basket filled with fruit
which they had brought for her.</p>
<p>Later in the day, as they weighed anchor
and sailed out from the shadow of
the great Rock, Blythe found herself
standing with Mr. Grey at the stern-rail
of their own deck, watching the face of
the mighty cliff as it changed with the
varying perspective.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! I wish I were a poet or an artist
or something!&#8221; she cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you take that monstrous fortress
for a subject?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and I should do something so
splendid with it that nobody would dare
to be satirical!&#8221; and she glanced defiantly
at her companion, whose good-humoured
countenance was wrinkling with amusement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us see,&#8221; he said. &#8220;How would
this do?&#8221; And he gravely repeated the
following:</p>
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>
<p style='margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;'>
&#8220;There once was a fortress named Gib,<br />
Whose manners were haughty and&mdash;</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></div>
<p>What rhymes with Gib?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Glib!&#8221; Blythe cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!</p>
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>
<p style='margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;'>
Whose manners were haughty and glib.<br />
<span style='margin-left: 3.90625em;'>If you tried to get in,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3.90625em;'>She replied with a grin,&mdash;</span></p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Quick! Give me another rhyme for Gib.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rib!&#8221; Blythe suggested, audaciously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Excellent, excellent! Rib! Now,
how does it go?</p>
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>
<p style='margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;'>
There once was a fortress named Gib,<br />
Whose manners were haughty and glib!<br />
<span style='margin-left: 3.90625em;'>If you tried to get in,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3.90625em;'>She replied, with a grin,</span><br />
&#8216;I&#8217;m Great Britain&#8217;s impregnable rib!&#8217;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Rather neat! Don&#8217;t you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O Mr. Grey!&#8221; Blythe cried. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
got to write that in my voyage-book! It&#8217;s
the&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>At that moment, a gesture from her
companion caused her to turn and look
behind her. There, only a few feet from
where they were standing, but with his
back to them, was the Count, sitting on
one of the long, stationary benches fastened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
against the hatchway, while just at
his knees stood little Cecilia. She was
balancing herself with some difficulty on
the gently swaying deck, holding out for
his acceptance a small bunch of violets,
which one of the market-women at Gibraltar
had bestowed upon her.</p>
<p>As he appeared to hesitate: &#8220;<i>Prendili!</i>&#8221;
she cried, with pretty wilfulness. Upon
which he took the little offering, and
lifted it to his face.</p>
<p>The child stood her ground resolutely,
and presently, &#8220;Put me up!&#8221; she commanded,
still in her own sweet tongue.</p>
<p>Obediently he lifted her, and placed
her beside him on the seat, where she sat
clinging with one little hand to the sleeve
of his coat to keep from slipping down,
with the gentle dip of the vessel.</p>
<p>The two sat, for a few minutes, quite
silent, gazing off toward the African
coast, and Blythe and her companion
drew nearer, filled with curiosity as to the
outcome of the interview.</p>
<p>Presently the child looked up into the
Count&#8217;s face and inquired, with the pretty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
Tuscan accent which sounded like an echo
of his own question on the evening of the
dance:</p>
<p>&#8220;What is thy name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Giovanni Battista Allamiraviglia.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cecilia repeated after him the long,
musical name, without missing a syllable,
and with a certain approving inflection
which evidently had an ingratiating effect
upon the many-syllabled aristocrat; for he
lifted his carefully gloved hand and passed
it gently over the little head.</p>
<p>The child took the caress very naturally,
and when, presently, the hand returned to
the knee, she got possession of it, and began
crossing the kid fingers one over the
other, quite undisturbed by the fact that
they invariably fell apart again as soon as
she loosed her hold.</p>
<p>At this juncture the two eavesdroppers
moved discreetly away, and Blythe, leaving
her fellow-conspirator far behind, flew
to her mother&#8217;s side, crying:</p>
<p>&#8220;O Mumsey! She&#8217;s simply winding
him round her finger, and there&#8217;s nothing
he won&#8217;t be ready to do for us now!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, dear; I&#8217;m delighted to hear it,&#8221;
Mrs. Halliday replied, with what Blythe
was wont to call her &#8220;benignant and
amused&#8221; expression. &#8220;And after a while
you will tell me what you are talking
about!&#8221;</p>
<p>But Blythe, nothing daunted, only appealed
to Mr. Grey, who had just caught
up with her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You agree with me, Mr. Grey; don&#8217;t
you?&#8221; she insisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perfectly, and in every particular.
Mrs. Halliday, your daughter and I have
been eavesdropping, and we have come
to confess.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whereupon Blythe dropped upon the
foot of her mother&#8217;s chair, Mr. Grey established
himself in the chair adjoining,
and they gave their somewhat bewildered
auditor the benefit of a few facts.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really believe,&#8221; the Englishman remarked,
in conclusion,&mdash;&#8220;I really believe
that haughty old dago can help us if anybody
can. And when your engaging
young prot&eacute;g&eacute;e has completed her conquest,&mdash;to-morrow,
it may be, or the day
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
after, for she&#8217;s making quick work of it,&mdash;we&#8217;ll
see what can be done with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, after all, what could have been
more natural than the attraction which,
from that time forth, manifested itself between
the Count and his small countrywoman?
If the little girl, in making her
very marked advances, had been governed
by the unwavering instinct which always
guided her choice of companions, the old
man, for his part, could not but find refreshment,
after his long, solitary voyage,
in the pretty Tuscan prattle of the child.
Most Italians love children, and the Count
Giovanni Battista Allamiraviglia appeared
to be no exception to his race.</p>
<p>The two would sit together by the hour,
absorbed, neither in the lovely sights of
this wonderful Mediterranean voyage, nor
in the movements of those about them,
but simply and solely in one another.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s telling her own story better
than we could do,&#8221; Mr. Grey used to say.</p>
<p>It was now no unusual thing to see the
child established on the old gentleman&#8217;s
knee, and once Blythe found her fast
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
asleep in his arms. But it was not until
the very last day of the voyage that the
most wonderful thing of all occurred.</p>
<p>The sea was smooth as a lake, and all
day they had been sailing the length of
the Riviera. All day people had been
giving names to the gleaming white points
on the distant, dreamy shore,&mdash;Nice, Mentone,
San Remo,&mdash;names fragrant with
association even to the mind of the young
traveller, who knew them only from books
and letters.</p>
<p>Blythe and the little girl were sitting,
somewhat apart from the others, on the
long bench by the hatchway where Cecilia
had first laid siege to the Count&#8217;s affections,
and Blythe was allowing the child to
look through the large end of her field-glass,&mdash;a
source of endless entertainment
to them both. Suddenly Cecilia gave a
little shriek of delight at the way her good
friend, Mr. Grey, dwindled into a pigmy;
upon which the Count, attracted apparently
by her voice, left his chair and came
and sat down beside them.</p>
<p>As he lifted his hat, with a polite
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
&#8220;<i>Permetta, Signorina</i>,&#8221; Blythe noticed, for
the first time on the whole voyage, that
he was without his gloves. Perhaps the
general humanising of his attitude, through
intercourse with the child, had caused him
to relax this little point of punctilio.</p>
<p>Cecilia, meanwhile, had promptly climbed
upon his knee, and now, laying hold of
one of the ungloved hands, she began
twisting a large seal ring which presented
itself to her mind as a pleasing novelty.
Presently her attention seemed arrested
by the device of the seal, and she murmured
softly, &#8220;<i>Fideliter</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blythe might not have distinguished the
word as being Latin rather than Italian,
had she not been struck by the change of
countenance in the wearer of the ring.
He turned to her abruptly, and asked, in
French:</p>
<p>&#8220;Does she read?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Blythe answered, thankful that
she was not obliged to muster her &#8220;conjugations&#8221;
for the emergency!</p>
<p>There was a swift interchange of question
and answer between the old man and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
the child, of which Blythe understood but
little. She heard Cecilia say &#8220;Mamma,&#8221;
in answer to an imperative question; the
words &#8220;<i>orologio</i>&#8221; and &#8220;<i>perduto</i>&#8221; were intelligible
to her. She was sure that the
crest and motto formed the subject of discussion,
and it was distinctly borne in upon
her that the same device&mdash;a mailed hand
and arm with the word <i>Fideliter</i> beneath
it&mdash;had been engraved on a lost
watch which had belonged to the child&#8217;s
mother. But it was all surmise on her
part, and she could hardly refrain from
shouting aloud to Mr. Grey, standing over
there, in dense unconsciousness, to come
quickly and interpret this exasperating
tongue, which sounded so pretty, and
eluded her understanding so hopelessly.</p>
<p>The mind of the Count seemed to be
turning in the same direction, for, after a
little, he arose abruptly, and, setting the
child down beside Blythe, walked straight
across the deck to the Englishman, whom
he accosted so unceremoniously that
Blythe&#8217;s sense of wonders unfolding was
but confirmed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></p>
<p>The two men turned and walked away
to a more secluded part of the deck, where
they remained, deep in conversation, for
what seemed to Blythe a long, long time.
She felt as if she must not leave her seat,
lest she miss the thread of the plot,&mdash;for
a plot it surely was, with its unravelling
close at hand.</p>
<p>At last she saw the two men striding
forward in the direction of the steerage,
and with a conspicuous absence of that
aimlessness which marks the usual promenade
at sea.</p>
<p>The little girl was again amusing herself
with the glasses, and, as the two arbiters
of her destiny passed her line of
vision, she laughed aloud at their swiftly
diminishing forms. Impelled by a curious
feeling that the child must take some
serious part in this crucial moment of her
destiny, Blythe quietly took the glasses
from her and said, as she had done each
night when she put her little charge to bed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you say a little prayer, Cecilia?&#8221;</p>
<p>And the child, wondering, yet perfectly
docile, pulled out the little mother-of-pearl
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
rosary that she always wore under her
dress, and reverently murmured one of
the prayers her mother had taught her.
After which, as if beguiled by the association
of ideas into thinking it bedtime, she
curled herself up on the bench, and, with
her head in Blythe&#8217;s lap, fell fast asleep.</p>
<p>And Blythe sat, lost in thought, absently
stroking the little head, until suddenly
Mr. Grey appeared before her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have been outrageously treated,
Miss Blythe,&#8221; he declared, seating himself
beside her, &#8220;but I had to let the old fellow
have his head.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t tell me anything, till we
find Mamma,&#8221; Blythe cried. &#8220;It&#8217;s all
her doing, you know,&mdash;letting me have
Cecilia up here,&#8221; and, gently rousing the
sleeper, she said, &#8220;Come, Cecilia. We
are going to find the Signora.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you consider it absolutely certain?&#8221;
Mrs. Halliday asked, when Mr.
Grey had finished his tale. She was far
more surprised than Blythe, for she had
had a longer experience of life, to teach
her a distrust in fairy-stories.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There does not seem a doubt. The
child&#8217;s familiarity with the crest was striking
enough, but that Bellini <i>Madonna</i>
clinches it. And then, Giuditta&#8217;s description
of both father and mother seems to
be unmistakable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! To think of his finding the
child that he had never heard of, just
as he had given up the search for her
mother!&#8221; Blythe exclaimed.</p>
<p>Cecilia was again playing happily with
the glasses, paying no heed to her companions.</p>
<p>&#8220;The strangest thing of all to me,&#8221;
Mrs. Halliday declared, &#8220;is his relenting
toward his daughter after all these years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must not forget that Fate had
been pounding him pretty hard,&#8221; Mr.
Grey interposed. &#8220;When a man loses in
one year two of his children, and the only
grandchild he knows anything about, it&#8217;s
not surprising that he should soften a bit
toward the only child he has left.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were still discussing this wonderful
subject, when, half an hour later, the
tall figure of the Count emerged from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
companionway. As he bent his steps toward
the other side of the deck he was
visible only to the child, who stood facing
the rest of the group. She promptly
dropped the glasses upon Blythe&#8217;s knee,
and crying, &#8220;<i>Il Signore!</i>&#8221; ran and took
hold of his hand; whereupon the two
walked away together and were not seen
for a long, long time.</p>
<p>Then Blythe and Mr. Grey went up
on the bridge and told the Captain. No
one else was to know&mdash;not even Mr.
DeWitt&mdash;until after they had landed, but
the Captain was certainly entitled to their
confidence.</p>
<p>&#8220;For,&#8221; Blythe said, &#8220;you know, Captain
Seemann, it never would have happened if
you had not sent us up in the crow&#8217;s nest
that day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Upon which the Captain, beaming his
brightest, and letting his cigar go out
in the damp breeze for the sake of making
his little speech, declared:</p>
<p>&#8220;I know one thing! It would neffer
haf happen at all, if I had sent anybody
else up in the crow&#8217;s nest but just Miss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
Blythe Halliday with her bright eyes and
her kind heart!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Blythe was so overpowered by this
tremendous compliment from the Captain
of the <i>Lorelei</i> that she had not a word to
say for herself.</p>
<p>That evening Mr. Grey inscribed his
nonsense-verse in Blythe&#8217;s book; and not
that only, for to those classic lines he
added the following:</p>
<p>&#8220;The above was composed in collaboration
with his esteemed fellow-passenger,
Miss Blythe Halliday, by Hugh Dalton,
<i>alias</i> &#8216;Mr. Grey.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>It was, of course, a great distinction to
own such an autograph as that; yet somehow
the kind, witty Mr. Grey had been so
delightful just as he was, that Blythe hardly
felt as if the famous name added so very
much to her satisfaction in his acquaintance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew it all the time,&#8221; she declared,
quietly; &#8220;but it didn&#8217;t make any difference.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s worth hearing,&#8221; said Hugh
Dalton.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>They parted from the little Cecilia at
sunrise, but with promises on both sides
of a speedy meeting among the hills of
Tuscany.</p>
<p>The old Count, with the child&#8217;s hand
clasped in his, paused as he reached the
gangway, at the foot of which the triumphant
Giuditta was awaiting them, and
pointed toward the rosy east which was
flushing the beautiful bay a deep crimson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Signorina,&#8221; he said in his careful
French, made more careful by his effort
to control his voice,&mdash;&#8220;Signorina, it is to
you that I owe a new dawn,&mdash;to you and
to your honoured mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, as Mr. DeWitt and Mr. Grey
approached, to tell them that everything
was in readiness for them to land, Blythe
turned, with the light of the sunrise in her
face, and said, under her breath, so that
only her mother could hear:</p>
<p>&#8220;O Mumsey! How beautiful the world
is, with you and me right in the very middle
of it!&#8221;</p>

<h2>Artful Madge</h2>
</div>
<p class='tp' style='font-size:1.2em;margin-bottom:20px;'>CHAPTER I</p>
<p class='tp' style='font-size:1em;margin-bottom:30px;'>THE PRIZE CONTEST</p>
<p>&#8220;Artful Madge&#8221; was the very
flippant name by which Madge
Burtwell&#8217;s brother Ned had persisted in
calling her from the time when, at the age
of sixteen, she gained reluctant permission
to become a student at the Art
School.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not that we have any objection to
art,&#8221; Mrs. Burtwell was wont to explain
in a deprecatory tone; &#8220;only we should
have preferred to have Madge graduate
first, before devoting herself to a mere
accomplishment. It seems a little like
putting the trimming on a dress before
sewing the seams up,&#8221; she would add;
&#8220;I did it once when I was a girl, and the
dress always had a queer look.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Mrs. Burtwell, though firm in her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
own opinions, was something of a philosopher
in her attitude toward the contrary-minded,
and even where her own children
were concerned she never allowed her influence
to degenerate into tyranny. When
she found Madge, at the age of sixteen,
more eager than ever before to study art,
and nothing else, she told her husband
that they might as well make up their
minds to it, and, at the word, their minds
were made up. For Mr. Burtwell was
the one entirely and unreasoningly tractable
member of Mrs. Burtwell&#8217;s flock; in
explanation of which fact he was careful
to point out that only a mature mind could
appreciate the true worth of Mrs. Burtwell&#8217;s
judgment.</p>
<p>The Burtwells were people of small
means and of correspondingly modest
requirements. They lived in an unfashionable
quarter of the city, kept a maid-of-all-work,
sent their children to the public
schools, and got their books from the
Public Library. Having no expensive
tastes, they regarded themselves as well-to-do
and envied no one.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></p>
<p>If Madge Burtwell&#8217;s eyes had been a
whit less clear, or her nature a thought
less guileless, Ned would not have been
so enchanted with his new name for her.
Indeed, a few years ago she had been
described by an only half-appreciative
friend as &#8220;a splendid girl without a mite
of tact,&#8221; and if she had succeeded in somewhat
softening the asperity of her natural
frankness, there was enough of it left to
lend a delicate shade of humour to the
name.</p>
<p>Artful Madge, then, was a student at
the Art School, and a very promising one
at that. At the end of three years she
had made such good progress that she was
promoted to painting in the Portrait Class,
and since her special friend and crony,
Eleanor Merritt, was also a member of
that class, Madge considered her cup of
happiness full. Not that there were not
visions in plenty of still better things to
come, but they seemed so far in the future
that they hardly took on any relation with
the actual present. Madge and Eleanor
dreamed of Europe, of the old masters
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
and of the great Paris studios, but it is a
question whether the fulfillment of any
dream could have made them happier
than they were to-day. Certain it is, that,
as they stood side by side in the great
barren studio, clad in their much-bedaubed,
long-sleeved aprons, and working away at
a portrait head, they had little thought for
anything but the task in hand. The one
vital matter for the moment was the mixing
and applying of their colours, and, in
their eagerness to reproduce the exact
contour of a cheek, or the precise shadow
of an unbeautiful nose, they would hardly
have transferred their attention from the
most ill-favoured model to the last and
greatest Whistler masterpiece.</p>
<p>The girls at the Art School had got
hold of Ned&#8217;s name for his sister and
adopted it with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to know the truth, ask
Artful Madge,&#8221; was a very common saying
among them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Artful Madge says it&#8217;s a good likeness,
anyhow!&#8221; modest little Minnie
Drayton would maintain, when hard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
pressed by the teasing of the older
girls.</p>
<p>The incongruity of the name seemed
somehow to throw into brighter relief the
peculiar sincerity of its bearer&#8217;s character,
and by the time it was generally adopted
among the students Madge Burtwell&#8217;s
popularity was established.</p>
<p>It was well that Madge was a favourite,
for in certain respects she was the worst
sinner in the class. To begin with, her
palette was the very largest in the room,
and the most plentifully besmeared with
colours, and woe to the girl who ventured
too near it! As Madge stood before her
easel, tall and fair and earnest, painting
with an ardour and concentration which
was all too sure to beguile her into her
besetting sin of &#8220;exaggerating details,&#8221;
she wielded both brush- and palette-arm
with a genial disregard of consequences.
Nor could one count upon her confining
her activities to one location. Like all
the students, she was in the habit of backing
away from her natural anchorage from
time to time, the better to judge of her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
work, and not one of them all had such a
fatal tendency to come up against an unoffending
easel in the rear, sending canvas
and paint-tubes rattling upon the floor.</p>
<p>Instantly she would drop upon her
knees, overcome with contrition, and help
collect the scattered treasures, giving
many a jar or joggle to neighbouring
easels in the process.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a shame, Miss Folsom!&#8221; she
would cry, struggling to her feet again,
still clutching her beloved palette, which
seemed fairly to rain colours on every
surrounding object. &#8220;It&#8217;s a shame! But
if you will just cast your eye upon that
thing of mine, you will perceive that it
was the recklessness of desperation. Look
at it! There&#8217;s not a value in it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Artful Madge was always forgiven, and
no one ever thought of calling her awkward,
and when, in the early autumn, a Saturday
sketching club was organised, it was
christened &#8220;The Artful Daubers&#8221; in
honor of Madge, and she was unanimously
elected president.</p>
<p>The girls were not in the habit of paying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
much attention to chance visitors who
came in from time to time and made the
perilous passage among the easels, and
lucky was the &#8220;parent&#8221; or &#8220;art-patron&#8221;
who escaped without a streak of colour on
some portion of his raiment. When Mrs.
Oliver Jacques looked in upon them one
memorable morning in February no premonition
of great things to come stirred
the company; only indifferent glances
were directed upon her by the few who
deigned to observe her at all. And this
pleased Mrs. Oliver Jacques very much
indeed.</p>
<p>Yet, if the girls had paused to consider,&mdash;a
thing which they never did when
there was a model on the platform,&mdash;they
would have been aware that their visitor
was a person of importance in the world
of Art, for importance in no other world
would have secured to her the personal
escort of Mr. Salome, the adored teacher
of their class. Yet Mrs. Jacques was a
charming little old lady who would have
commanded attention on her own merits
in any less preoccupied assembly than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
that of the studio. Her exceedingly
bright eyes and her exceedingly white
hair seemed to accentuate her animation
of manner; there was so much sparkle in
her face that even her silence did not
lack point.</p>
<p>She had accomplished her tortuous passage
among the easels without meeting
with any mishaps in the shape of Cremnitz-white
or crimson-lake. She had
paused occasionally and had bestowed a
critical nod upon the one &#8220;blocked-in&#8221;
countenance, or had drawn her brows together
questioningly over a study in which
the nose had a startlingly finished appearance
in a still sketchy environment, but
not until she had successfully avoided the
last easel, planted at an erratic angle just
where the unwary would be sure to stub
his toe, did she make any remark.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of them, aren&#8217;t there?&#8221; she
observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, the school is pretty full,&#8221; Mr.
Salome replied. &#8220;In fact, we&#8217;re a little
bothered for room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Any imagination among them?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, as to that, it&#8217;s rather early to
form an opinion. Our aim just now is to
keep them to facts. Some of them,&#8221; the
artist added with a smile, &#8220;are rather too
much inclined to draw upon their imagination.
Now there is one girl there who
is, humanly speaking, certain to paint the
model&#8217;s hair jet-black, or as black as paint
can be made. And yet, you see, there is
not a black thread in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder whether you would object to
my making an experiment?&#8221; Mrs. Jacques
asked, abruptly.</p>
<p>And from that seemingly unpremeditated
question of Mrs. Jacques&#8217;, and from
the consultation that ensued, grew the
Prize Contest, destined to be famous in
the annals of the school.</p>
<p>When, on that very afternoon, the students
were assembled for the occasion,
they had not yet had time to adjust their
minds to the magnitude of the interests
involved. Yet the conditions were simple
enough. That student who should, in the
space of two hours, produce the best composition
illustrative of &#8220;Hope&#8221; was to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
receive a prize of five hundred dollars!
The conviction prevailed among them that
the vivacious little old lady with the white
hair could be none other than the fairy
godmother of nursery lore, and it was
only too delightful to find that agile and
beneficent myth interesting herself in the
cause of Art.</p>
<p>When once the class was fairly launched
upon its new emprise, a change in the
usual aspect of things became apparent.
In the first place, most of the students
were seated; for, in a task of pure composition,
there was no occasion either for
standing or for &#8220;prowling,&#8221;&mdash;the term
familiarly applied to the sometimes disastrous
backward and forward movements
of which mention has been made, and
which ordinarily gave so much action to
the scene. Furthermore, the use of watercolor,
as lending itself more readily than
oils to rapid execution, deprived the scene
of one of its most picturesque features,&mdash;namely,
the brilliant-hued palette which,
with its similarity to a shield, was wont to
lend its bearer an Amazonian air, not lost
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
upon the class caricaturists. Subdued,
however, and almost &#8220;lady-like&#8221; as the
appearance of the class had become,
hardly half an hour had passed before
the genial spirit of creation had so taken
possession of the assembly as to cast a
glow and glamour of its own upon it.
Here and there, to be sure, might still be
seen an anxious, intent young face with
eyes fixed upon vacancy, or an idle, if
somewhat begrimed and parti-coloured
hand, fiercely clutching a dejected head;
but nearly all were already busily at work,
eagerly painting, or as eagerly obliterating
strokes too hastily made. The subject,
hackneyed as it certainly is, had
pleased and stimulated the girls. There
was a mingled vagueness and familiarity
in its suggestion which puzzled them and
spurred them on at the same time.</p>
<p>Among the most impetuous workers,
almost from the outset, was Artful Madge.
She had instantly conceived of Hope as a
vague, beckoning figure, which was to take
its significance from the multitude and variety
of its followers. She chose a large
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
sheet of paper and quickly sketched in
the upper left-hand corner a very indefinite
hint of a winged, luminous something,&mdash;it
might have been an angel or a bird or
a cloud, seen from a great distance, against
a somewhat threatening sky. Without
defining the form at all she very cleverly
produced an impression of receding motion;&mdash;she
ventured even to hope that
there was something alluring in the motion.
That, however, must be made unmistakably
clear through the pursuing
figures with which she proposed to fill
the foreground.</p>
<p>She glanced at Eleanor, who had not
yet mixed a colour.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you waiting for?&#8221; she
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t seem ready to begin,&#8221; said
Eleanor, in an absent tone of voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you got an idea?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then do hurry up and go ahead, or
you&#8217;ll get left.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge sat a moment, looking straight
before her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to put in there?&#8221;
asked Eleanor.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I want is all the people in the
world,&#8221; Madge replied, with perfect gravity.
&#8220;But there is not room for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>A moment later she was working furiously,
with hot cheeks and shining eyes
and breath coming faster and faster.</p>
<p>First she would have a soldier. Madge
had always loved a soldier; her father had
been one in the great and splendid days
before she was born. Yes, a soldier must
come first. And forthwith a very sketchy
warrior stepped, with a very martial air,
upon the paper. Then an artist ought to
come next;&mdash;only she could not think of
any way of indicating his calling without
the aid of some conventional emblem. A
mere look of inspiration might belong to
a poet or a preacher as well as to an
artist. Besides which, she was by no means
sure that she knew how to paint a look of
inspiration. And then it came to her
that, unless she could paint just that, her
picture must be a failure; and so she fell
upon it, and began sketching in figures of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
old and young, rich and poor, trying only
to put into each face the eager, upward
look which should focus all, in spirit as
well as in actual direction, upon the flying,
luminous figure. In some attempts
she succeeded and in some she failed.
There was one old woman, with abnormally
deep wrinkles, and shoulders somewhat
out of drawing, whose face had
caught a curiously inspired look; Madge
did not dare touch her again for fear of
losing it. Her artist, on the other hand,
the young man with the ideal brow and
very large eyes, grew more and more inane
and expressionless the more eagerly his
creator worked at him.</p>
<p>On the whole, the production as a two-hour
composition by a three-year student
was rather good than bad. When time
was called Madge felt pretty sure that she
should not win the prize; she had undertaken
too much, both for the occasion and
for her own ability. And yet it was borne
in upon her to-day that she was going to
make a better artist than she had ever
before dared hope.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></p>
<p>So absorbed had she been in her own
work, that she had completely forgotten
Eleanor, and had not even been aware
that her friend had begun painting an
hour ago. Now she turned to her with
compunction in her heart. Eleanor held
her finished sketch in her hand, but her
eyes had wandered to the high, broad
north window which was one great sheet
of radiant blue sky.</p>
<p>Eleanor&#8217;s composition was very simple,
but extremely well done, and in the glance
Madge was able to give it before the
sketches were handed in she saw that it
was delicately suggestive. It represented
a curving shore, a quiet sea, and a saffron
sky,&mdash;no sails on the sea, no clouds in
the sky. Upon the shore stood a solitary
pine-tree, almost denuded of branches,
and against the tree leaned the slender
figure of a youth, looking dreamily across
the sea to the horizon, where the saffron
colour was tinged with gold. That was
all, but Madge felt sure that it was
enough; and, as she thought about it,
she felt herself very small and crude and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
confused, and she was conscious of a perfectly
calm and dispassionate wish to tear
her own sketch in two. She did not do
so, however. There was no irritation, nor
envy, nor even displeasure, in her mind.
She had not supposed that either she or
Eleanor could do anything so good as
that sketch,&mdash;since one of them could,
why, that was just so much clear gain.</p>
<p>A moment later the studio was in a
tumult. The sketches had been handed
over to the three judges, who had gone
into instant consultation over them. Mrs.
Jacques had decreed, with characteristic
decision, that the judges were bound to
be as prompt as the competitors, and the
award was promised within half an hour.
What wonder if the usual tumult of dispersion
was increased tenfold by the excitement
of the occasion? The voices
were pitched in a higher key, the easels
clattered more noisily than ever, there was
a more lively movement among the many-hued
aprons, as they were pulled off and
consigned with many a shake and a flourish
to their respective pegs.</p>

<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 366px;'>
&#8220;Eleanor&#8217;s eyes had wandered to the high, broad north window.&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What did you paint?&#8221; asked one high
voice, whose owner was enthusiastically
shaking the water from her paint-brush
all over the floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I painted you&mdash;working for the prize.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not really!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, really! You were just at the right
angle for it, and you did look so hopeful!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t make me believe you played
such a shabby trick upon me, Mary Downing!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shabby! If you knew how good-looking
you were at a three-eighths&#8217; angle you
would be grateful to me! You did have
such an inspired look for a little while,&mdash;before
you got disgusted, and began to
wash out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jane Rhoades did an awfully pretty
thing&mdash;a white bird with a boy running
after it. But I felt perfectly certain that
the little wretch had a gun in his other
hand!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What a fiery head you gave your
angel, Mattie Stiles! He looked like
Loge in <i>Rheingold!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; said Mattie, in a tone of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
voice that showed that she did care very
much indeed. &#8220;I do like red hair, and
we haven&#8217;t had a chance to paint any all
winter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Red hair wouldn&#8217;t make Titians of
us,&#8221; sighed Miss Isabella Ricker, who was
of a despondent temperament.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be any hindrance, anyhow!&#8221;
Mattie insisted.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the half-hour was drawing to
a close. A general air of rough order had
descended upon the studio. The girls were
sitting or standing about in groups, their
remarks getting more disjointed and irrelevant
as the nervousness of anticipation
grew upon them. Madge and Eleanor
had found a seat on the steps of the platform.
The former was making a pencil
sketch of Miss Isabella Ricker, who had
abandoned herself to dejection in a remote
corner of the room. Madge looked up
suddenly, and found that Eleanor was
watching her work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your thing is very interesting,&#8221; she
remarked, in a reserved tone, which, nevertheless,
sent the colour mounting slowly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
up her friend&#8217;s sensitive cheek. They
both understood that no more commendatory
adjective than &#8220;interesting&#8221; was to
be found in the art-student&#8217;s vocabulary.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re partial, Madge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it. But I know an interesting
thing when I see it. If you win
the prize,&#8221; she asked abruptly, &#8220;what shall
you do with the money?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you go to the moon next week,
what shall you do with the green cheese?&#8221;
Eleanor retorted, with an unprecedented
outburst of sarcasm.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you might answer my question,&#8221;
said Madge; and at that instant
the door opened and a hush fell upon the
room.</p>
<p>The suspense was not painfully prolonged.
The Curator of the Art Museum,
who had been associated with Mrs.
Jacques and Mr. Salome as judge, stepped
upon the platform, from which Madge
and Eleanor had precipitately retreated,
and made the following announcement:</p>
<p>&#8220;We have, on the whole,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;been very well pleased with the work we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
have had to consider. In fact, several of
the sketches were better than anything
we had looked for. Nevertheless our decision
was not a difficult one, and our
choice is unanimous. The prize which
Mrs. Jacques has had the originality and
the generosity to offer has been awarded
to Mary Eleanor Merritt.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&#8220;And now will you answer my question?&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge and Eleanor were walking home
together through the light snow which
had just begun to fall. They had been
curiously shy of speaking, and, before the
silence was broken, a pretty wreath of
snow had formed itself about the rim of
each of their black felt hats, while little
ribbons of it were decorating the folds of
their garments.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do with your
green cheese?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall go to Paris next autumn,&#8221; said
Eleanor, tightly clasping the check which
she held inside her muff.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I thought,&#8221; said Madge;
and if her eyes grew a trifle red and
moist it was perhaps natural enough,
since the snow was flying straight into
them.</p>

<p class='tp' style='font-size:1.2em;margin-bottom:20px;'>CHAPTER II</p>
<p class='tp' style='font-size:1em;margin-bottom:30px;'>THE MINIATURE</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes you keep looking at
me, Eleanor Merritt? You&#8217;re
not a bit of a good model!&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus reproved, Eleanor once more fixed
her eyes upon a very bad oil-portrait of
Great-grandfather Burtwell, an elderly
man of a wooden countenance, in stock
and choker, surmounting an expanse of
black broadcloth which occupied two-thirds
of the canvas.</p>
<p>The girls were established in what was
known as the spare-room of the Burtwell
house, which, with its north light and
usual freedom from visitors made a very
good studio. Madge was painting a miniature
of Eleanor. The diminutive size of
her undertaking was causing her a good
deal of embarrassment, and she was consequently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
inclined to be rather severe with
her sitter.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know I am not going to have
many more chances of looking at you for
a year to come,&#8221; Eleanor urged, in a tone
of meek dejection.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I can&#8217;t see you, even now,&#8221; Madge
persisted, &#8220;if you don&#8217;t turn more toward
the light.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was silence again for some minutes,
while Madge painted steadily on.
Difficult as was this new task which she
had set herself, she was captivated with it.
However the miniature might turn out as
a likeness, she felt sure that each stroke of
her brush was making a prettier picture of
it. The eyes already had the real Eleanor
look, and the hair was &#8220;pretty nice.&#8221; The
mouth was troublesome, to be sure, and
to-day she did not feel inspired to improve
it, and had turned her attention to less
important details.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got such a pretty ear!&#8221; she
remarked presently, as she touched its
outermost rim with a hair line, cocking
her head to one side, the while, in a very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
professional manner; &#8220;Did you ever notice
what a pretty ear you have?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better be careful how you talk about
it,&#8221; Eleanor laughed, &#8220;for fear it should
begin to burn!&#8221;</p>
<p>The artist looked in some trepidation
at the feature in question, but its soft hue
did not deepen. She took the precaution,
however, to change the subject; to one
which she often chose, indeed, for the
sake of the animation it brought into the
pretty face of her model. Eleanor&#8217;s &#8220;repose&#8221;
sometimes bothered her.</p>
<p>&#8220;What shall you do the first day in
Paris?&#8221; Madge asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall write to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good gracious! You won&#8217;t write to
me before you have seen the Louvre!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall write to you the very first minute.
And then I shall write again that
same evening, and tell you whether there
really is a Louvre! If there shouldn&#8217;t be
one, you know, I shouldn&#8217;t feel so like a
pig in being there without you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t feel like a pig, as far
as that goes,&#8221; said Madge. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
have gone to Paris if I had won the
prize.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I had it out with Father this
morning. He says it&#8217;s not a mere matter
of money; that if he and Mother thought
well of my going, they could manage it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O Madge! Can&#8217;t you make them
think well of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid not. Father never did
really believe in my going in for art, and
I think he believes in it less now than
he ever did. He says I&#8217;ve been at it
for three years, and I haven&#8217;t painted a
pretty picture yet. And he says he
doesn&#8217;t see what good it&#8217;s going to do
me in after-life; that if I marry I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t
keep it up, and there wouldn&#8217;t be any
good in my trying to;&mdash;which is, of course
a mistake, only I can&#8217;t make him believe
that it is,&mdash;and he says that if I don&#8217;t
marry, I&#8217;ve got to earn my living sooner
or later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, but that&#8217;s just it, Madge!
You&#8217;re going to be able to earn your
living! You&#8217;re sure to!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></p>
<p>But Madge was again engrossed in her
work. The afternoon would soon draw to
a close, and if she wished to carry out her
designs upon that ear it behooved her to
stop talking. Though her little picture
was an oval of three inches by four, it had
cost her more strokes than any canvas of
ten times the size had ever done. And
Eleanor was to sail in a fortnight!</p>
<p>At last the light began to fade, and
Madge knew that she must stop.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you suppose Father said to
me this morning?&#8221; she asked, as she
washed out her brushes and put her paint-box
in order.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he said that when any good
judge thought my pictures worth paying
for in good hard cash, it would be time to
think of sending me &#8216;traipsing over the
world with my paint-pot.&#8217; He said that
if I would come to him with a fifty-dollar
bill of my own earning he should begin to
think there was some sense in my art-talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he really say that? Why, Madge,
who knows?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></p>
<p>Madge had shut up her paint-box and
moved to the window, where she was
gloomily looking down into her neighbours&#8217;
backyards.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you mean Noah&#8217;s Dove,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;You might as well give him up. He&#8217;s
come back for the thirteenth time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now &#8220;Noah&#8217;s Dove&#8221; was the name
which Madge had bestowed upon a small
bundle of pen-and-ink sketches which she
had been sending about to the illustrated
papers for two or three months past, and
which had earned their name by the persistency
with which they had found their
way back again. The girls had both
thought them funny and original; indeed
Eleanor, with the partiality of one&#8217;s best
friend, did not hesitate to pronounce them
better than many of the things that got
accepted. Up to this time, however, no
editor had seemed disposed to recognise
their merits, and they had been repeatedly
and ignominiously rejected.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ll keep on sending them,
won&#8217;t you, Madge?&#8221; Eleanor insisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I shall, as long as there is a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
picture-paper left in the country; though
the postage does cost an awful lot!&#8221;</p>
<p>The sun had set, and a tinge of rosy
colour was spreading across the northern
sky behind the chimneys. The girls stood
silent for a moment, watching the colour
deepen, while a wistful look came into
Eleanor&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;After all, Madge,&#8221; she said; &#8220;it must
be nice to have somebody think for you,
even when he doesn&#8217;t think the way you
want him to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, of course, Father&#8217;s a dear. I
don&#8217;t suppose I would swap him off, even
for Paris!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I could even remember my
father or my mother, or anybody that
really belonged to me!&#8221; Eleanor said;
then, feeling that she was making an appeal
for sympathy, a thing which she was
principled against doing, she turned her
eyes away from the tender, beguiling
colour behind the chimneys, and looked,
instead, at the big oil portrait on the wall.
&#8220;It&#8217;s something to have even a painted
grandfather of your own!&#8221; she declared.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How I should love to give you mine!&#8221;
laughed Madge. &#8220;He&#8217;s such a horrible
daub, and I should so like to have the frame
when it comes time to exhibit! You
would not insist upon having him in a
frame, would you, Nell?&#8221;</p>
<p>Presently the girls went down-stairs together
and Eleanor stayed to tea, and
told the family all about her Paris plans,
and how she felt like a pig to be going
without Madge. And all the time, as she
talked to these kindly, sympathetic people,
it seemed to her that Madge was even
more to be envied than she; and she
wished she knew how to say so in an acceptable
manner. But Eleanor found as
much difficulty as most of us do, in expressing
our best and truest thoughts, and
so the Burtwell family never knew what a
heart-warming impression they had made
upon their guest.</p>
<p>Eleanor had lived for the past three
years with a married cousin, a daughter
of the not particularly congenial or affectionate
Aunt Sarah, now deceased, who
had brought her up from babyhood. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
gentle, sensitive girl, with the artistic temperament,
had never been happy with her
cousin, though the latter was far from suspecting
the fact. Mrs. Hamilton Hicks
was fond of Eleanor, or imagined herself
to be so, and she always gave her
young cousin her due share of credit, in
view of the fact that they had &#8220;never
had any words together.&#8221; Nevertheless,
she had acceded very readily to the Paris
plan, and had herself taken pains to
find a suitable chaperon for the young
traveller.</p>
<p>The result was, that on the fifteenth of
September Eleanor went forth into the
great world in company with a lively and
voluble Frenchwoman, a lady whom she
had seen but twice before in her life, who
had promised to establish her in a good
private family in Paris. And since Mrs.
Hamilton Hicks had negotiated the arrangement,
its success was a foregone
conclusion.</p>
<p>When Madge left the railway station
after bidding Eleanor good-bye, and
stepped out into the crowded city thoroughfare,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
the world seemed to her very
empty and desolate, in spite of the multitude
of her fellow-creatures who jostled
against her. She could think of nothing
but Eleanor, standing on the platform of
the car as the train moved out of the
station, and she was desperately sorry to
have lost the last sight of her friend&#8217;s tearful
face, because of a curious blur that had
come over her own eyes at the moment.
At the recollection, she mechanically put
her hand into her pocket in search of the
miniature which she usually carried about
with her. She had left it at home lest
she should lose it in the crowded railway
station. It gave her a pang not to find
it, and she made up her mind then and
there that she would never go without
it again.</p>
<p>The moment she reached her own room
she seized the picture and had a good look
at it. She had placed it in the inner gilt
rim of an old daguerreotype, which set it
off very nicely. She had discarded the
hard leather daguerreotype case, as being
too clumsy to carry about in her pocket,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
and in its place had made a sort of pocket-book
of red morocco which was a sufficient
protection for the glass, in her careful
keeping.</p>
<p>She had never liked the picture so well
as she did to-day, for she thought of it
now for the first time, not as a work of art,
but as a likeness, and imperfect as it was,
even from that point of view, it gave her
very great pleasure to look at it. Yes, decidedly,
she must always have it by her
hereafter; and she slipped it into her
pocket while she made herself ready for
tea.</p>
<p>But supposing she should have her
pocket picked! A pickpocket, she reflected,
might, in the hastiness which must
always characterise his operations, mistake
the little leather case for a purse, and
then&mdash;how should she ever get the precious
miniature back again? &#8220;Not that
he would want to keep it,&#8221; she said to herself,
as she took it out once more for a
parting look,&mdash;&#8220;unless he should lose
his heart to that ear!&#8221;&mdash;and she regarded
the tiny pink object with pardonable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
pride. But with the best intentions in
the world, how would he be able to restore
it? She must put her address in the
case; that would be a simple matter.</p>
<p>An hour later, the family were gathered
about the great round table in the pleasant
sitting-room, pursuing their various
avocations by the light of an excellent
argand burner. Mr. Burtwell was reading
his evening paper, imparting occasional
choice bits to his wife and his eldest
daughter, Julia, who were dealing with
a heap of mending. The two younger
children were playing lotto, while Ned
was having a hand-to-hand tussle with his
Cicero, a foeman likely to prove worthy
of his steel.</p>
<p>Madge had taken out a sheet of paper,
with a view to inscribing her address upon
it. The mere act of doing so had called
up to her mind so vivid an impression of
the thief for whose information it was destined,
that she suddenly felt impelled to
address to him a few words of admonition.
With an agreeable sense of the absurdity
of her performance, she began a letter to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
this figment of her imagination, and this
is what she wrote:</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Dear Pickpocket</span>,</p>
<p>&#8220;For, as I shall never leave this miniature
about anywhere, you must be a pickpocket
if it falls into your hands. To
begin with, then; it is not a good miniature
at all, and there is no use in your
trying to sell it. In fact, it is a very bad
miniature, as you will see if you know
anything about such things, which you
probably don&#8217;t. But it is very valuable
to me, and so I hope you will return it to
me as soon as you find out how bad it is.
You probably won&#8217;t want to bring it
yourself,&mdash;I&#8217;m sure I should not think
you would!&mdash;but you can perfectly well
send it by express, and you can let them
collect charges on delivery, unless you
think that, under the circumstances, you
ought to prepay them. My address is,</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:0.0em; text-align:right'>Miss Margaret Burtwell,&#8221; etc.<br /></p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Madge read over her production with
an amusement and satisfaction which
quite filled, for the moment, the aching
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
void of which she had been so painfully
conscious. The letter occupied but one-half
the sheet, and, as the young artist&#8217;s
eye fell upon the blank third page, she
was seized with an irresistible impulse to
draw a picture on it.</p>
<p>The figure of the pickpocket was by
this time so vivid to her mind, that she
began making a pen-and-ink sketch of
him, as a dark-browed villain in the act
of rifling the pocket of a very haughty
young woman proceeding along the street
with an air of extreme self-consciousness.
The drawing was on a very small scale, and
when it was finished to her satisfaction
there was still half the page unoccupied.
Madge hastily wrote under the sketch the
words: &#8220;The Crime,&#8221; and a moment later
she was engrossed in the execution of a
still more dramatic design, representing
the criminal in the hands of two stalwart
policemen, being ignominiously dragged
through the street toward a sort of medi&aelig;val
fortress, with walls some twenty feet
thick, upon which was inscribed in enormous
characters, &#8220;JAIL.&#8221; Still more action
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
was given the drawing by the introduction
of two or three small and gleeful
ragamuffins, dancing a derisive war-dance
behind the captive, and of two dogs of
doubtful lineage, barking like mad on the
outskirts of the group. Under this picture
was inscribed, &#8220;The Consequences of
Crime,&#8221; and at the bottom of the page appeared
the words, &#8220;Behold and tremble!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s Artful Madge up to?&#8221; asked
Ned, as he closed his Latin Dictionary
with a bang.</p>
<p>&#8220;Writing a letter,&#8221; Madge replied,
composedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;To the Prize Pig?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Prize Pig! You know Eleanor
said she felt like a pig to be going to
Paris without you, and as she got the
prize&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You impudent boy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in the least. I&#8217;m only witty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Witty!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&mdash;I&#8217;ve heard wit defined as the
unexpected.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The dictionary doesn&#8217;t define it so,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
and good manners don&#8217;t define impudence
as wit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not discussing impudence,
we&#8217;re discussing wit. And I know
positively that wit is defined as the unexpected.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s have your authority,&#8221; said Mr.
Burtwell, who had not heard the first part
of the discussion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us see what the dictionary says,&#8221;
suggested Julia, who was the scholar of
the family.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well; and what will you bet that
I&#8217;m not right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t bet in this family,&#8221; said Mr.
Burtwell, with decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, that&#8217;s only a form of speech.
What will you do for me, Madge, if I&#8217;m
right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll put you into an allegorical sketch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good! I always wondered that you
didn&#8217;t make use of such good material in
the artful line!&#8221;</p>
<p>The wire dictionary-stand, containing
the portly form of Webster Unabridged,
was instantly brought up to the light, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
there was half a minute&#8217;s silence while
Ned turned the leaves.</p>
<p>&#8220;Score me one!&#8221; he shouted, in high
glee. &#8220;Listen to Webster! &#8216;Wit. 3.
Felicitous association of objects not usually
connected, so as to produce a pleasant
surprise.&#8217; Quite at your service, my artful
relative, whenever you would like a
sitting!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I protest! You haven&#8217;t won!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t won, indeed! I leave it to
the gentlemen of the jury. Is not the
name of Prize Pig for Miss Eleanor Merritt
a &#8216;felicitous association of objects not
usually connected&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No! The association is infelicitous,
and consequently it does not produce a
&#8216;pleasant surprise.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>The family listened with the amused
tolerance with which they usually left such
discussions to the two chief wranglers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I maintain,&#8221; insisted Ned, &#8220;that the
association of objects is felicitous, and
must be, because it was instituted by Miss
Eleanor Merritt herself. She won the
prize, and she said she was a pig.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But it doesn&#8217;t produce a pleasant surprise,&#8221;
Madge objected.</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon! It <i>has</i> produced
a pleasant surprise, as I can testify, for I
have experienced it myself. What is your
verdict, Mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My verdict is, that it&#8217;s a pity, as I
always thought it was, that you are not
to be a lawyer, and that Madge can&#8217;t do
better than practise her drawing by making
the allegorical sketch.&#8221;</p>
<p>That Mrs. Burtwell should be on Ned&#8217;s
side was a foregone conclusion, and Madge
appealed to her father.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father, is calling Eleanor Merritt a
prize pig a form of wit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty poor wit I should call it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Father is on my side!&#8221; shouted Ned.
&#8220;He says it&#8217;s poor wit, which is only one
way of saying that it is wit!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can wit be poor?&#8221; asked Julia.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father says it can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it isn&#8217;t wit!&#8221; Madge protested.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like to know why not. Old
Mr. Tanner is a poor man, but he&#8217;s a
man for all that, and votes at elections
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
for the highest bidder. And your logic&#8217;s
poor, but I suppose you&#8217;d call it logic!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have an idea!&#8221; cried Madge. &#8220;I&#8217;m
going to make my fortune out of you!
I&#8217;m going to make a pair of excruciatingly
funny pictures of you! The first
shall be called <i>The Student and Logic</i>,
and the second shall be called <i>Logic and
the Student!</i> In the first the student
shall be patting Logic on the head, and in
the second,&mdash;oh, it&#8217;s an inspiration!&#8221;</p>
<p>And forthwith Madge seized a large
sheet of paper and began work.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure that this won&#8217;t be the
beginning of a series,&#8221; she declared.
&#8220;When it&#8217;s finished I shall send it to a
funny paper and get fifty dollars for it,&mdash;and
when I have got fifty dollars for it,
Father will send me to Paris; won&#8217;t you,
Daddy, dear?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that? What&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked
Mr. Burtwell.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I get fifty dollars,&mdash;<i>or more!</i>&mdash;for
my Student, you will send me to
Europe!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes! And when you&#8217;re Queen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
of England I shall be presented at Court!
Listen to what the paper says: &#8216;The
Honourable Jacob Luddington and family
have just returned from an extensive
foreign tour. The two Miss Luddingtons
were presented at the Court of St.
James, where their exceptional beauty and
elegance are said to have made a marked
impression.&#8217; Good for the Honourable
Jacob! His father was my father&#8217;s chore-man,
and here are his daughters hobnobbing
with crowned heads!&#8221;</p>
<p>From which digression it is fair to conclude
that Mr. Burtwell did not attach
any great importance to his daughter&#8217;s
question or to his own answer. But
Madge put away the promise in the safest
recesses of her memory as carefully as she
had tucked the letter to her &#8220;dear pickpocket&#8221;
inside the red morocco pocket-book.
It seemed as if the one were likely
to be called for about as soon as the
other,&mdash;&#8220;which means never at all!&#8221; she
said to herself, with a profound sigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;The throes of creation have begun,&#8221;
Ned chuckled; and then, as he watched
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
his sister&#8217;s business-like proceedings, marvelling
the while at what he secretly considered
her quite phenomenal skill, he let
himself be sufficiently carried away by
enthusiasm to remark, &#8220;I say, Madge,
you&#8217;re no fool at that sort of thing, if
you <i>are</i> a girl!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='chapter' />

<p class='tp' style='font-size:1.2em;margin-bottom:20px;'>CHAPTER III</p>
<p class='tp' style='font-size:1em;margin-bottom:30px;'>NOAH&#8217;S DOVE</p>
<p>&#8220;I really think, Miss Burtwell, you
might be a little more careful,&#8221;
Miss Isabella Ricker wailed, in a tone of
hopeless remonstrance. It was the third
time that morning that Madge had
knocked against her easel, and human
nature could bear no more.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so too,&#8221; said Madge, in a voice
as dejected as her victim&#8217;s own. &#8220;If I
only knew how to prowl more intelligently,
I would, I truly would.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tie yourself to your own easel,&#8221; suggested
Delia Smith; &#8220;then that will have
to go first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a good one to talk!&#8221; cried
Mary Downing. &#8220;You&#8217;ve upset my
things twice this very morning!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Put those two behind each other,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
Josephine Wilkes suggested. &#8220;It will be
a lesson to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And who&#8217;s going to sit behind the
rear one?&#8221; somebody asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Harriet Wells,&#8221; Delia Smith proposed.
&#8220;Mr. Salome said &#8216;very good&#8217; to her this
morning; she must be proof against
adversity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No one is proof against adversity,&#8221;
Madge declared, in a tragic tone; but her
remark passed unheeded. The girls were
already at work again, and nothing short
of another wreck was likely to distract
their attention. The scrape of a palette-knife,
the tread of a prowler, or the shoving
of a chair to one side, were the only
sounds audible in the room, excepting
when the occasional roar of an electric car
or the rattle of a passing waggon came in
at the open window. It was the first warm
day in April.</p>
<p>Artful Madge&#8217;s sententious observation
with regard to adversity was the fruit of
bitter experience. Misfortune&#8217;s arrows
had been raining thick and fast about her,
and although she was holding her ground
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
against them very well, she felt that adversity
was a subject on which she was fitted
to speak with authority.</p>
<p>In the first place, her Student series
was proving to be quite as much of a
Noah&#8217;s Dove as the first set of sketches
which had so signally failed to find a permanent
roosting-place in an inhospitable
world. Only yesterday the familiar parcel
had made its appearance on the front-entry
table, that table which, for a year
past, she had never come in sight of without
a quicker beating of the heart. If
she ever did have a bit of success, she
often reflected, that piece of ancestral mahogany
was likely to be the first to know
of it. How often she had dreamed of
the small business envelope, addressed in
an unfamiliar hand, which might one day
appear there! It would be half a second
before she should take in the meaning of
it. Then would come a premonitory thrill,
instantly justified by a glance at the upper
left-hand corner of the envelope, where
the name of some great periodical would
seem literally blazoned forth, however
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
small the type in which it was printed.
And then,&mdash;oh, then! the tearing open of
the envelope, the unfolding of the sheet
with trembling fingers, the check! Would
it be for $10 or $15 or even $25, and
might there be a word of editorial praise
or admonition? Foolish, foolish dreams!
And there was that hideous parcel, which
she was getting to hate the very sight of!
As she squeezed a long rope of burnt-sienna
upon her palette, she made up her
mind that she would wait a week before
exposing herself to another disappointment.
Perhaps the Student would improve
with keeping, like violins and old
masters. Certainly if he was anything
like his prototype he needed maturing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the model&#8217;s mouth was proving
as troublesome to paint as Eleanor&#8217;s
had been, and as Madge grew more and
more perplexed with the problem of it she
thought of the miniature with a fresh
pang. For she had lost it! Three days
ago it had somehow slipped from her possession.
Had she left it lying on the
table in the Public Library? Nobody
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
there had seen anything of it. But on
the very day of her loss she had been at
the Library, examining the current numbers
of all the illustrated papers, in the
hope of gleaning some hint as to editorial
tastes. She remembered reading Eleanor&#8217;s
last letter there, the letter in which
her friend had written that she was to
have two years more of Paris. She had
read the letter through twice, and then she
had taken out the miniature and had a
good look at it. To think of Eleanor,
having two more years of Paris! And it
had all come about so simply! She had
merely persuaded her cousin, Mr. Hicks, to
advance a few hundred dollars till she
should be of age and at liberty to sell a
bond.</p>
<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t anybody that believes in
me,&#8221; Madge had told herself; and then
she had thought of something that Mr.
Salome had said to her a few days ago,
something that she would have considered
it very unbecoming to repeat, even to
Eleanor, but the memory of which, thus
suddenly recalled, had filled her with such
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
hopefulness that she had sped homeward
to the mahogany table almost with a conviction
of success. Was it in that sudden
rush of hopefulness, so mistaken, alas, so
groundless, that she had left the little
morocco case lying about? Or had she
pulled it out of her pocket with her handkerchief?
Or had she really had her
pocket picked?</p>
<p>What wonder that in the stress of
anxious speculation she was making bad
work of her painting! This would never
do! She took a long stride backwards,
and over went Miss Ricker&#8217;s long-suffering
easel, prone upon the floor, carrying with
it a neighbouring structure of similar unsteadiness,
which was, however, happily
empty, save for a couple of jam-pots filled
with turpentine and oil! These plunged
with headlong impetuosity into space, forming
little rivers of stickiness, as they rolled
half-way across the room. Everybody
rushed to the rescue, while Miss Ricker
gazed upon the catastrophe with stony
displeasure.</p>
<p>By a miracle, the canvas, though &#8220;butter-side-down,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
had escaped unscathed.
Not until she was assured of this did the
culprit speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a disgrace to the class,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;and expulsion is the only remedy. Tell
Mr. Salome that I have forfeited every
right to membership, and it&#8217;s quite possible
that I may never exaggerate another
detail as long as I live.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Time&#8217;s up in two minutes,&#8221; Mary
Downing remarked, in her matter-of-fact
voice, as she dabbed some yellow-ochre
upon her subject&#8217;s chin. &#8220;I rather think
you&#8217;ll come back to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I do think it&#8217;s somebody&#8217;s else
turn to work behind her,&#8221; said Josephine
Wilkes.</p>
<p>Miss Ricker gave a faint, assenting
smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Miss Ricker is very much indebted
to Artful Madge,&#8221; Harriet Wells
declared. &#8220;There isn&#8217;t another girl in
the class who could have knocked that
easel over without damaging the picture.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Practice makes perfect,&#8221; some one
observed; and then, time being called,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
everybody began talking at once, and
wit and wisdom were alike lost upon the
company.</p>
<p>But Artful Madge was not to be lightly
consoled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; she said, that same afternoon,
as she came into the little sitting-room
over the front entry, where her
mother was stitching on the sewing-machine,
&#8220;I think I should like to do
something useful. I&#8217;m kind of tired of
art.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge had been helping wash the
luncheon dishes, and was beginning to
wonder whether her talents were not,
perhaps, of a purely domestic order.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think you <i>would</i> be tired of
it!&#8221; said Mrs. Burtwell, in perfect good
faith, as she snipped the thread at the
end of a seam. &#8220;How you can make up
your mind to spend all your days bedaubing
your clothes with those nasty paints
passes my comprehension.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But sometimes I daub the canvas,&#8221;
Madge protested, with unwonted meekness,
as she drew a grey woollen sock over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
her hand, and pounced upon a small hole
in the toe; and at that very instant, which
Madge was whimsically regarding as a possible
turning-point in her career, the doorbell
rang.</p>
<p>&#8220;A gintleman to see you, Miss,&#8221; said
Nora, a moment later, handing Madge a
card.</p>
<p>&#8220;To see me?&#8221; asked Madge, incredulously,
as she read the name, &#8220;Mr. Philip
Spriggs! Are you sure he didn&#8217;t ask
for Father?&#8221;</p>
<p>But Nora was quite clear that she had
not made a mistake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is it, Madge?&#8221; Mrs. Burtwell
queried.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s probably a book agent,&#8221; said
Madge, as she went down-stairs to the
parlour, rather begrudging the interruption
to her darning bout.</p>
<p>Standing by the window, hat in hand,
was an elderly man of a somewhat severe
cast of countenance, as unsuggestive as
possible, in his general appearance, of the
comparatively frivolous name which a satirical
fate had bestowed upon him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></p>
<p>As Madge entered the room he observed,
without advancing a step toward
her: &#8220;You are Miss Burtwell, I suppose.
I came to answer your letter in person.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My letter?&#8221; asked Madge, with a
confused impression that something remarkable
was going forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; this one,&#8221;&mdash;and he drew from
his pocket the red morocco miniature case.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; cried Madge, &#8220;how glad I am
to have it!&mdash;and how kind you are to
bring it!&mdash;and, oh! that dreadful letter!&#8221;</p>
<p>The three aspects of the case had
chased each other in rapid succession
through her mind, and each had got its-self
expressed in turn.</p>
<p>Mr. Spriggs did not relax a muscle of
his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I found this on a table in the Public
Library,&#8221; he stated. &#8220;Your directions
were so explicit that I could do no less
than be guided by them.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was something so solemn, almost
judicial, about her guest that Madge became
quite awestruck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you please take a seat?&#8221; she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
begged, humbly. &#8220;I think I could apologise
better if you were to sit down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you consider that there is occasion
to apologise?&#8221; he asked, taking the
proffered chair, and resting his hat upon
the floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, yes!&#8221; said Madge. &#8220;It&#8217;s
perfectly dreadful to think of the letter
having fallen into the hands of any one
so&mdash;&#8221; and she broke short off.</p>
<p>&#8220;So what?&#8221; asked Mr. Spriggs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, so dignified and so&mdash;very different
from&mdash;&#8221; but again she found herself
unable to finish her sentence.</p>
<p>&#8220;From a &#8216;dear pickpocket?&#8217;&#8221; he suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I say &#8216;dear pickpocket&#8217;?&#8221; cried
Madge in consternation. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know
I said &#8216;dear.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you desired to make a
favourable impression, in order to get
your picture back. There are some very
good points about the picture,&#8221; he remarked,
as he took it out of the case and
examined it. &#8220;There&#8217;s a good deal of
drawing in it, and considerable colour.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know about pictures?&#8221; asked
Madge with eager interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much. I&#8217;ve heard more or less
art-jargon in my day; that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge looked at him suspiciously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure you will agree with me that
I don&#8217;t know much,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;when
I tell you that I prefer your pen-and-ink
work to the miniature. &#8216;The Consequences
of Crime&#8217; is full of humour; and
I have been given to understand that you
can&#8217;t produce an effect without skill,&mdash;what
you would probably dignify with the
name of technique. The second small
boy on the right is not at all bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You do know about art!&#8221; cried
Madge. &#8220;I rather think you must be an
artist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Spriggs did not exactly change
countenance; he only looked as if he
were either trying to smile or trying not to.
Madge wished she could make out just
what were the lines and shadows in his face
that produced this singular expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you never thought of doing anything
for the papers?&#8221; he asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Thought of it! I&#8217;ve spent four dollars
and sixty-one cents in postage within
the last ten months, and he always comes
back to the ark!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;He&#8217;? Comes back where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To the ark. I call the package
&#8216;Noah&#8217;s Dove&#8217; because it never finds a
place to roost.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The original dove did, after a while.&#8221;
Mr. Spriggs spoke as if he were taking
the serious, historical view of the incident.
&#8220;I imagine yours will, one of these days.
Have you got anything you could show
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you really care to see?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell till you show me,&#8221; he said
cautiously; but this time there was something
so very like a smile among the stern
features that Madge could see just what
the line was that produced it.</p>
<p>She flew to her room, and seized Noah&#8217;s
Dove, and in five minutes that much-travelled
bird had spread his wings,&mdash;all
six of them,&mdash;for the delectation of this
mysterious critic.</p>
<p>Madge watched him, as he leaned back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
in his chair and examined the sketches.
He seemed inclined to take his time over
them, and she felt sure that her Student
had never before been so seriously considered.</p>
<p>At last Mr. Spriggs laid the drawings
upon the table and fixed his thoughtful
gaze upon the artist. His contemplation
of her countenance was prolonged a good
many seconds, yet Madge did not feel in
the least self-conscious; it never once
occurred to her that this severe old gentleman
was thinking of anything but her
Student. She found herself taking a very
low view of her work, and quite ready to
believe that perhaps, after all, those unappreciative
editors knew what they were
about.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you ever sent these to the <i>Gay
Head?</i>&#8221; her visitor inquired casually.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no! I should not dare send anything
to the <i>Gay Head!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why! Because it&#8217;s the best paper in
the country. It would never look at my
things.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly won&#8217;t if you never give it
a chance. You had better try it,&#8221; he went
on, in a tone that carried a good deal of
weight. &#8220;You know they can do no
worse than return it; and I should think,
myself, that the <i>Gay Head</i> was quite as
well worth expending postage-stamps on
as any other paper. Mind; I don&#8217;t say
they&#8217;ll take your things,&mdash;but it&#8217;s worth
trying for. By the way,&#8221; he added as he
rose to go; &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t send No. 5 if I
were you; it&#8217;s a chestnut.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had picked up his hat and stood on
his feet so unexpectedly that Madge was
afraid he would escape her without a word
of thanks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, please wait just a minute,&#8221; she
begged. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t told you a single
word of how grateful I am. I feel somehow
as if,&mdash;as if,&mdash;<i>the worst were over!</i>&#8221;
This time Mr. Spriggs smiled broadly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you will send Noah&#8217;s Dove to
the <i>Gay Head?</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I will, because you advise me to.
But you mustn&#8217;t think I&#8217;m conceited
enough to expect him to roost there.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></p>
<p>And that very evening the dove spread
his wings,&mdash;only five of them now,&mdash;and
set forth on the most ambitious flight he
had yet ventured upon.</p>
<p>In the next few days Madge found her
thoughts much occupied with speculations
regarding her mysterious visitor; everything
about him, his name, his errand,
both the matter and the manner of his
speech, roused and piqued her curiosity.
It was clear that he knew a great deal
about art. And yet, if he were an artist,
she would certainly be familiar with his
name. Whatever his calling, he was sure
to be distinguished. Those judicial eyes
would be severe with any work more pretentious
than that of a mere student; that
firm, discriminating hand,&mdash;she had been
struck with the way he handled her
sketches,&mdash;would never have signed a poor
performance. Perhaps it was Elihu Vedder
in disguise,&mdash;or Sargent, or Abbey!
Since the descent of the fairy-godmother
upon the class a year ago, no miracle
seemed impossible. And yet, the miracle
which actually befell would have seemed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
of all imaginable ones, the most incredible.
It took place, too, in the simplest, most
unpremeditated manner, as miracles have
a way of doing.</p>
<p>One evening, about a week after the
return of the miniature, the family were
gathered together as usual about the argand
burner. It was a warm evening, and
Ned, who was to devote his energies to
the cause of electrical science, when once
he was delivered from the thraldom of
the classics, had made some disparaging
remarks about the heat engendered by
gas.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way,&#8221; said Mr. Burtwell, &#8220;that,
reminds me! I have a letter for you,
Madge. I met the postman just after I
left the door this noon, and he handed me
this with my gas bill. Who&#8217;s your New
York correspondent?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Madge,
with entire sincerity, for it was far too
early to look for any word from the <i>Gay
Head</i>.</p>
<p>The letter had the appearance of a
friendly note, being enclosed in a square
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
envelope, undecorated with any business
address. Madge opened it, and glanced
at the signature, which was at the bottom
of the first page. The blood rushed to
her face as her eye fell upon the name:
&#8220;Philip Spriggs, Art Editor of the <i>Gay
Head</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>She read the letter very slowly, with a
curious feeling that this was a dream, and
she must be careful not to wake herself
up. This was what she read:</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>My dear Miss Burtwell</span>,</p>
<p>&#8220;We like Noah&#8217;s Dove as much as I
thought we should. We shall hope to get
him out some time next year. Can&#8217;t you
work up the pickpocket idea? That small
boy, the second one from the right, is
nucleus enough for another set. In fact,
it is the small-boy element in your Student
that makes him original&mdash;and true to life.
We think that you have the knack, and
count upon you for better work yet. We
take pleasure in handing you herewith a
check for this.</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:0.0em; text-align:right'><span style='margin-right: 3.125em;'>&#8220;Yours truly,</span><br />
<span style='margin-right: 1.0em;'>&#8220;<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Philip Spriggs</span>.&#8221;</span><br /></p>
<hr class='tb' />
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></div>
<p>The check was a very plain one on thin
yellow paper, not in the least what she had
looked for from a great publishing-house;
but the amount inscribed in the upper
left-hand corner of the modest slip of
paper seemed to her worthy the proudest
traditions of the <i>Gay Head</i> itself. The
check was for sixty dollars.</p>
<p>As Madge gradually assured herself
that she was awake, the first sensation
that took shape in her mind was the very
ridiculous one of regret that the mahogany
table should have been deprived
of its legitimate share in this great event.
And then she remembered that it was her
father himself who had handed her the
letter.</p>
<p>She was still wondering how she should
break the news to him, when she found
herself giving an odd little laugh, and asking,
&#8220;Father, what is your favourite line
of ocean steamers?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Burtwell, who had really felt no
special curiosity as to his daughter&#8217;s correspondent,
was once more immersed in
his evening paper. He looked up, at her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
words, as all the family did, and was
struck by the expression of her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes you ask that?&#8221; he demanded
sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I know you always keep
your promises, and&mdash;there&#8217;s a letter you
might like to read.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Burtwell took the letter, frowning
darkly, a habit of his when he was
puzzled or anxious. He read the letter
through twice, and then he examined
the check. He did not speak at once.
There was something so portentous in
this deliberation, and something so very
like emotion in his kind, sensible face,
that even Ned was awed into respectful
silence.</p>
<p>At last Mr. Burtwell turned his eyes to
his daughter&#8217;s face, where everything,
even suspense itself, seemed arrested, and
said, in a matter-of-fact tone:</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you had better go by the
North German Lloyd. Shall you start
this week?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you darling!&#8221; cried Madge, throwing
her arms about her father&#8217;s neck, regardless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
of letter and check, which, being
still in his hands, were called upon to bear
the brunt of this attack; &#8220;How can I ever
make up my mind to leave you?&#8221;</p>

</div>
<p class='tp' style='font-size:1.2em;margin-bottom:20px;'>CHAPTER I</p>
<p class='tp' style='font-size:1em;margin-bottom:30px;'>DAN&#8217;S PLIGHT</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Well</i>, Mis&#8217; Lapham, I <i>am</i> sorry to
hear it, I <i>must</i> say! It <i>doos</i> seem&#8217;s
though you&#8217;d <i>had</i> your share of affliction!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Henry Dodge always emphasised
a great many of her words, which habit
gave to her remarks an impression of
peculiar sincerity and warmth; a perfectly
correct impression, too, it must be admitted.
Her needle, moreover, being
quite as energetic as her tongue, she was
a valuable member of the sewing-circle, at
which function she was now assisting with
much spirit.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lapham accepted this tribute to
her many trials with becoming modesty.
She was a dull, colourless woman whose
sole distinction lay in the visitations of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
affliction, and it is not too much to affirm
that she was proud of them. She was
sewing, not too rapidly, on a very long
seam, which occupation was typical of her
course of life. She sighed heavily in
response to her neighbour&#8217;s words of sympathy,
and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;It did seem hard that it should have
been Dan, just as he was beginning to
be a help to his uncle, and all. But I
s&#8217;pose we&#8217;d ought to have been prepared
for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been quite a pause in the
death-roll,&#8221; the Widow Criswell observed.
She was engaged in sewing a button on a
boy&#8217;s jacket with a black thread.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long is it since Eliza went?&#8221;
asked Miss Louisa Bailey, pursuing the
widow&#8217;s train of thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seven years this month. She began
to cough at Christmas, and by Washington&#8217;s
Birthday she was in her grave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Jane? They didn&#8217;t go very far
apart, did they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Jane died eleven months before
Eliza; and their mother went three years
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
before that, and their father when Dan
was a baby; that&#8217;s goin&#8217; on sixteen
years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Well</i>, you <i>have</i> had a hard time, I
<i>will</i> say!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Dodge. &#8220;Your
Martha losing her little girl, and John&#8217;s
wife breaking her collar-bone, and all, and
now <i>this</i> to be gone through with! I
<i>should</i> think you&#8217;d feel <i>discouraged</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do; real discouraged. But I s&#8217;pose
it&#8217;s no more than I&#8217;d ought to expect,
with such an inheritance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have there been many cases of lung-trouble
on your side of the family, Mrs.
Lapham?&#8221; Miss Bailey inquired with
respectful interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; Sister Fitch was the first case.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a few seconds, conversation languished,
and only the snip of Mrs.
Royce&#8217;s scissors could be heard, and the
soft rustle of cotton cloth. The sewing-circle
was going on in the church vestry
where there was a faint odour from the
kerosene lamps, which had just been
lighted. The Widow Criswell was the first
to break the silence.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Polly ain&#8217;t showed no symptoms yet,
has she?&#8221; she asked, testing one of the
buttons as if sceptical of her thread.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, no; not yet. But then Dan
seemed as smart as anybody six months
ago, and just look at him to-day!&#8221;</p>
<p>The mental eyes of a score of women
were turned upon Dan, as he was daily
seen, round-shouldered and hollow-chested,
toiling along the snowy country roads
to and from school, coughing as he went.
The topic was not an uncongenial one to
the members of the sewing-circle, who
had really very little to talk about. So
absorbed were they, indeed, in the discussion
of poor Dan&#8217;s fate, and of the long
list of casualties that had preceded it, that
no one noticed the entrance of a young
girl, rosy-cheeked and bright-eyed, who
had come to help with the supper. There
was an air of peculiar freshness about her,
and as she stood in her blue dress and
white apron near the door, her ruddy
brown hair shining in the lamp-light, the
effect was like the opening of a window in
a close room. Her step was arrested in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
the act of coming forward, and, as she
paused to listen, the pretty colour was
quite blotted out of her cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think Dan&#8217;s will be a lingering
case,&#8221; Mrs. Lapham was saying. &#8220;The
lingering cases are the most trying.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly stood motionless. Was it true
then, that which she had dreaded, that
which she had shrunk from facing? Was
it more than a cold that Dan had got?
Was Dan really ill? Her Dan? Really
ill? Her heart was beating like a trip-hammer,
but no one seemed to hear
it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Queer that the doctors don&#8217;t find any
cure for lung-trouble,&#8221; Mrs. Royce was
saying. &#8220;Seems as though there must
be some way of stopping it, if you could
only find it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you tried Kinderling&#8217;s Certain
Cure?&#8221; asked Mrs. Dodge. &#8220;They do
say that it&#8217;s <i>very</i> efficacious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, no,&#8221; said Mrs. Lapham; &#8220;I
don&#8217;t hold much to medicines myself;
but if I did I should think it just a wilful
waste to try them for Dan. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
boy&#8217;s doomed, to begin with, and there&#8217;s
no help for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There <i>is</i> a help for it, there <i>shall</i> be
a help for it!&#8221; cried a voice, vibrating
with youthful energy and emotion. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t see how you can talk so, Aunt Lucia!
Dan <i>isn&#8217;t</i> doomed! he <i>sha&#8217;n&#8217;t</i> die!
I won&#8217;t <i>let</i> him die!&#8221;</p>
<p>The women looked at Polly and then
they looked at one another, fairly abashed
by the girl&#8217;s spirit; all, that is, excepting
Aunt Lucia, who was not impressionable
enough to feel anything but the superficial
rudeness of Polly&#8217;s outbreak.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll do, Polly,&#8221; she said, with a
spiritless severity. &#8220;This is no place for
a display of temper.&#8221;</p>
<p>The colour had come back into the
girl&#8217;s face now, and there were hot tears
in her eyes. She turned without a word
and left the room, nor was she seen again
among the waitresses who came to hand
the tea.</p>
<p>Polly was rather ashamed of having run
away from the sewing-circle, and she had
serious thoughts of going back. It was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
the first time in her life that she had
allowed herself to be routed by circumstances;
but somehow she felt as if she
could not find it in her heart to hand
about tea and seed-cakes, sandwiches and
quince-preserve, to people who could think
such dreadful thoughts of Dan. And
then, besides, she knew what a pleasant
surprise it would be for Dan to have her
all to himself for an evening. Uncle Seth
would be sure to go for his weekly game
of checkers with Deacon White, and she
could help Dan with his algebra and
Latin, and see that he was warm and
&#8220;comfy,&#8221; and perhaps find that he did
not cough so much as he did the evening
before.</p>
<p>They had a very cozy evening, she and
Dan, just as she had planned it in every
particular but one, namely, the cough.
There was no improvement in that since
the night before, and for the first time the
boy spoke of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, Polly! Isn&#8217;t it stupid, the way
this cold hangs on? Do you remember
how long it is since I caught it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why, no, Dan. It does seem a good
while, doesn&#8217;t it? I guess it must be
about over by this time. Don&#8217;t you know
how suddenly those things go?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dan, who was on his way to bed, had
stopped, close to the air-tight stove, to
warm his hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish it were summer, Polly,&#8221; he said,
with a wistful look in his great black eyes
that cut Polly to the heart. &#8220;It&#8217;s been
such a cold winter; and a fellow gets kind
of tired of barking all the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be spring before you know it,
Dan, you see if it isn&#8217;t, and you&#8217;ll forget
you ever had a cold in your life.&#8221;</p>
<p>And when, half an hour later, the evening
was over, and Polly was safe in her
bed, she buried her head in her pillow and
cried herself to sleep.</p>
<p>But tears and bewailings were not a
natural resource with Polly, whose forte
was action. Her first thought in the
morning was: what should she do about
it? Something must be done, of course,
and she was the only one to do it. What
it was she had not the faintest idea, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
then it was her business to find out. Here
was she, eighteen years old, strong and
hearty, and with good practical common
sense, the natural guardian and protector
of her younger brother. It was time she
bestirred herself!</p>
<p>As a first step, she got up with the sun
and dressed herself, and then she slipped
down-stairs to the parlour where such of
her father&#8217;s books as had been rescued from
auction were lodged; her father had been
the village doctor. All the medical works
had been sold, and many other volumes
besides, but among those remaining was
an old encyclop&aelig;dia which had proved to
Polly a mine of information on many subjects.
As she took down the third volume,
she heard a portentous <i>Meaouw!</i> and
there, outside the window, stood Mufty,
the grey cat, rubbing himself against the
frosty pane. Polly opened the window
and Mufty sprang in, bringing a puff of
frosty air in his wake. Without so much
as a word of thanks he walked over to the
stove. Finding it, however, cold, as only
an empty air-tight stove can be cold, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
strolled, with a disengaged air, beneath
which lurked a very distinct intention, toward
the only warm object in the room,
namely, Polly in her woollen gown. She
had the volume open on the table before
her, and was deep in its perusal, murmuring
as she read.</p>
<p>&#8220;Appears to have committed its ravages
from the earliest time,&#8221; Polly read,
&#8220;and its distribution is probably universal,
though far from equal.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this point Mufty lifted himself lightly
in the air, after the manner peculiar to
cats, and landed in Polly&#8217;s lap. After
switching his tail across her eyes once or
twice, and rubbing himself against the
book in rather a disturbing way, he at last
settled down, and began purring vigorously
in token of satisfaction. The room
was very cold, and Polly, without interrupting
her reading, was glad to bury her
hands in the thick fur. Presently the
colour in her cheeks grew brighter and her
breath came quicker. There <i>was</i> a way,
after all! People had been saved, people
a good deal sicker than Dan,&mdash;saved by a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
change of climate. What could be simpler?
Just to pick Dan up and carry him
off! And such fun, too!</p>
<p>&#8220;Mufty,&#8221; she whispered, excitedly,
&#8220;Mufty, what should you say to Dan and
me going away and never coming back
again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Brrrrr, brrrrr</i>,&#8221; quoth Mufty.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew you would approve! You
know how necessary it is, and you think
it best to do it; don&#8217;t you, Mufty?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Brrrr, brrrrrrrrrr</i>,&#8221; quoth Mufty,
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;O Mufty, what a darling you are, to
approve! And there isn&#8217;t really any
one&#8217;s opinion that I care more about!&#8221;</p>
<p>She got up and went to the window,
while Mufty, not to be dislodged, hastily
established himself across her shoulder,
his fore paws well down her back, his tail
contentedly waving before her eyes. The
picture which he thus turned his back
upon was a wintry one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cold morning, isn&#8217;t it, Mufty?&#8221; said
Polly. &#8220;No kind of a climate for a delicate
person.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Brrrr, brrrrrr!</i>&#8221; Mufty was digging
a claw into her shoulder to adjust
himself more comfortably.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ow!&#8221; cried Polly. Then, lifting him
down: &#8220;Mufty, you&#8217;re a very intelligent
cat, and I haven&#8217;t a doubt that your
judgment is as penetrating as your claws.
All the same, I guess you&#8217;d better get
down and come with me and help Susan
get the breakfast. Don&#8217;t you hear her
shaking down the kitchen stove?&#8221;</p>
<p>Whereupon Mufty, finding himself
dropped upon the coldly unsympathetic
ingrain carpet, desisted from further encouraging
remarks.</p>
<p>Polly was a schoolgirl still, though she
was nearing the dignity of graduation.
She had no special taste for study, but
she cherished the Yankee reverence for
education, and although it was not quite
clear to her how Latin declensions and
algebraic symbols were to help her in
after-life, she committed them to memory
with a very good grace, and enjoyed all
the satisfaction of work for work&#8217;s sake.</p>
<p>It happened, therefore, that the pursuit
of learning interfered for several hours
with the far more important object which
she had at heart to-day; and it was not
until two o&#8217;clock that she found herself
at liberty to do what every nerve and fibre
of her young organism was straining to
accomplish.</p>

<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 359px;'>
&#8220;Mufty hastily established himself across her shoulder.&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going right home,&#8221; she said
to Dan; &#8220;I&#8217;ve got an errand to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Polly&#8217;s got an idea,&#8221; Dan said to himself,
struck with the eagerness in her face,
and the haste with which she walked
away. &#8220;What a girl she is for ideas, any
way!&#8221; and he trudged along the snowy
road with the other boys, getting rather
out of breath in the effort to keep up
with them.</p>
<p>Polly, meanwhile, stepped swiftly on
her way. She was thinking of Dan. He
at least was a natural student and had always
led his class. She was not only
fond of Dan, but proud of him, too. He
was a handsome boy, with those clear,
dark eyes of his in which a less partial observer
than Polly might have read the
promise of fine things.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Polly said to herself, as she
sped along the road that glittering winter&#8217;s
day: &#8220;Dan isn&#8217;t just an ordinary
boy. He&#8217;s an unusual boy. Why, the
world couldn&#8217;t <i>afford</i> to lose Dan!&#8221; and
she looked into the faces of the passers-by,
as if to challenge their acquiescence in
this bold statement.</p>
<p>Whether Dan was all that Polly thought
him, only the future could prove,&mdash;that
future that Polly was about to secure to
him. If she idealised him a bit, why, all
the better for Dan, and all the better for
Polly, too. One thing is sure, that no
one who could have looked into the sister&#8217;s
heart that winter&#8217;s day would have
doubted her for an instant when she said
to herself:</p>
<p>&#8220;He sha&#8217;n&#8217;t die! I won&#8217;t let him die!
But, <i>oh! how I wish that cough were mine!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>From her interview with the doctor,
Polly brought away with her only one
word, &#8220;<i>Colorado</i>&#8221;; and with that word
shining like a great snowy peak in her
imagination, she took another swift walk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
to a farmhouse on the outskirts of the
village, where dwelt a man whose son had
gone to Colorado three years ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;Great place!&#8221; he told her; &#8220;Great
place, Colorado! Mile up in the air!
Prairie-dogs and Rocky Mountains! Big
cattle ranches that could put all Fieldham
in their vest pockets! Cold as thunder,
hot as thunder! Blizzards and cyclones
and water-spouts! Wind! Blow you
right out of your boots! Cures sick
folks? Oh, yes. Better than all the
doctors. Braces &#8217;em right up&mdash;stands
&#8217;em on their legs! Nothing like it, so
Bill says. Costs a sight to get out there;
oh, yes! Fifty dollars and fifteen cents!
Queer about that fifteen cents. Seems
as though they might ha&#8217; throwed that in
on such a long trip&#8217;s that; but them railroads
ain&#8217;t got no insides any way; and
when you once git out there, why, <i>there
you are!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>The philosophy of that last remark appealed
particularly to Polly. &#8220;When you
once git out there, why, <i>there you are!</i>&#8221;
Somehow it seemed to make everything
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
perfectly simple and easy. Blizzards and
cyclones? Yes, to be sure. But then
it was the air that you went out for,
Polly reasoned, that was what was
going to cure you; and perhaps the
more you got of it the quicker you
would get cured. And Polly hurried
home from her last visit, flushed and
eager for the fray. She found her uncle
in the barn putting up his horses.</p>
<p>Mr. Seth Lapham was a good man;
there could be no doubt about that.
Nothing but a sincere and very efficient
conscience could have so tempered his
natural penuriousness as to cause him to
receive into his family a mere sister-in-law&#8217;s
children and allow them to &#8220;want
for nothing&#8221;; that, too, at a time when
his own children, John and Martha, were
still a bill of expense to him, before their
respective marriages. For many years,
Uncle Seth had conscientiously, if not
lavishly, fed and clothed the little orphans,
whose entire patrimony in the Savings
Bank scarcely yielded interest enough to
pay for their boots and shoes; but it remained
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
for the present crisis to prove
him as open-minded as he was conscientious.
For, no sooner had Polly finished
the rapid exposition of her great plan&mdash;how
they were to draw the money from the
bank to pay for their tickets and start
them in their new life, and how they were
to earn their own living when once they
got started&mdash;than he was ready to admit
the reasonableness of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;And when you once get out there,
why, there you are!&#8221; Polly declared, in her
most convincing tone.</p>
<p>As she stood before him, flushed and
breathless, prepared to do battle for Dan
to the very last extremity, her uncle gave
old Dick a slap that sent him tramping
into his stall, and then said, with the
drawling accent peculiar to him:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Polly, you&#8217;re a pretty sensible
girl. If the doctor says so, I guess it&#8217;s
wuth trying.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Polly, who had so courageously
braced herself for the contest, experienced
an overwhelming revulsion of feeling, and
a great wave of gratitude and compunction
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
swept over her. To Uncle Seth&#8217;s
speechless astonishment she flung her
arms around his big neck, and, with some
thing very like a sob, she cried:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Uncle Seth, I never loved you
half enough!&#8221;</p>
<p>Uncle Seth bore it very well, all things
considered. He got pretty red in the
face, but happily a full grizzly beard kept
the secret of his blushes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Polly!&#8221; he said, pounding away
on her shoulder in an attempt to be consolatory;
&#8220;you&#8217;ve always ben a good
girl; not a mite of trouble, not a mite!&#8221;</p>
<p>They walked up to the house, Polly
holding the rough, hairy hand as tightly as
if it had been a solid chunk of gold. Before
the short walk to the kitchen door
was finished they had become sworn conspirators,
and Uncle Seth was so entirely
in the spirit of the piece that he held Polly
back a minute to say, in a sepulchral
whisper,</p>
<p>&#8220;Just you leave your Aunt Lucia to
me. I&#8217;ll fix her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly never knew all the pains Uncle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
Seth was at to &#8220;fix&#8221; Aunt Lucia, but
by hook or crook the &#8220;fixing&#8221; was accomplished,
and Aunt Lucia had given a
mournful consent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t feel it right,&#8221; she declared,
&#8220;to let you suppose I thought there was
any hope of its curing Dan. That boy&#8217;s
doomed, if ever a boy was, and I don&#8217;t
know how you&#8217;ll ever manage with the
funeral and all, way out there in Colorado,
far from kith and kin. But your Uncle
Seth says you&#8217;d better try it, and I ain&#8217;t
one to oppose just for the sake of opposin&#8217;.
I&#8217;ve been through too much for that.
Only I warn you; mind, you don&#8217;t forget
I warned you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly listened to Aunt Lucia&#8217;s lugubrious
views with scarcely a twinge of alarm,
and in five minutes she had plunged into
preparations for the journey.</p>
<p>As for Dan, the mere thought of Colorado
seemed to revive him. &#8220;Larks&#8221;
of any description had always been very
much to his taste, but the unending &#8220;lark&#8221;
of an escape into the big world with Polly
filled him with a fairly riotous joy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></p>
<p>And so it happened that by the time
the March thaws were setting in and the
March winds were getting ready for their
boisterous attack, Polly and Dan had
slipped away, and were travelling as fast
as steam could carry them toward the
high, health-giving region of the Rocky
Mountains.</p>
<p>&#8220;A harebrained venture as ever was!&#8221;
Miss Louisa Bailey declared when she
heard of it. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see what Mr. and
Mrs. Lapham were thinking of, to countenance
such a step!&#8221;</p>
<p>The monthly sewing-circle had come
round again, and Mrs. Lapham, whose
turn it was to look after the supper, had
stepped out of the room for a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know but it&#8217;s about as
well,&#8221; the Widow Criswell rejoined, sighing
profoundly. She was more out of
spirits than usual to-day, for circumstances,
otherwise known as Mrs. Royce, the
president of the sewing-circle, had forced
into her hands a baby&#8217;s pinafore, the
cheerful suggestiveness of which could
only serve to deepen her gloom. &#8220;The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
boy&#8217;s doomed, wherever he is, and Sister
Lapham never had any real taste for sick-nursing.
She&#8217;s spared a sight o&#8217; trouble
and expense.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Well</i>,&#8221; said Mrs. Henry Dodge, winding
a needleful of No. 20 thread off the
spool, with the hissing sound familiar to
the ears of the seamstress, and breaking
it off with a snap, &#8220;<i>I</i> think it&#8217;s the very
<i>best</i> thing that could have been <i>done</i>. The
minute I <i>saw</i> that girl&#8217;s face last sewing-circle,
I <i>knew</i> she&#8217;d make out to <i>save that
boy</i>. Mark my words, he&#8217;ll outlive us all
<i>yet!</i> I declare, I always <i>did</i> like Polly
Fitch. She reminds me of <i>myself</i> when <i>I</i>
was a girl!&#8221;</p>

<p class='tp' style='font-size:1.2em;margin-bottom:20px;'>CHAPTER II</p>
<p class='tp' style='font-size:1em;margin-bottom:30px;'>WESTWARD HO!</p>
<p>&#8220;Pike&#8217;s Peak or Bust!&#8221; was the chosen
motto of those early pilgrims who,
thirty-odd years ago, crossed the continent
in a &#8220;prairie schooner,&#8221; escorted by
a cavalry guard to keep Indian marauders
at a respectful distance; and &#8220;Pike&#8217;s
Peak or Bust!&#8221; was the motto chosen by
Polly and Dan, our two young modern
pilgrims, as they journeyed with greater
ease, but with no less courage and venturesomeness,
across the two thousand
miles intervening between quiet Fieldham
and their goal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pike&#8217;s Peak or Bust!&#8221; No one looking
into the bright young faces turned so
bravely westward ho! could have had
any doubt as to which of the two alternatives
hinted at in that picturesque motto
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
would be fulfilled for them. On they
journeyed, on and on, past populous
cities, across great rivers, over vast plains
brown with last year&#8217;s stubble or white
with newly fallen snow, till at last there
came a morning when they awoke in the
tingling dawn, and, looking forth across
miles of shadowy prairie, beheld a great
white dome cut clear against a sapphire
sky. On the train rushed, on and on,
straight toward that snowy dome, and, as
they drew nearer, other mountains began
to define themselves on either side the
central peak, and presently a town revealed
itself, and they knew that it could
be no other than Colorado Springs, sleeping
there at the foot of the great range,
all unconscious of the two young pilgrims,
coming so confidingly to seek their fortunes
within its borders.</p>
<p>Their first spring and summer were a
very happy time, of which Polly and Dan
could relate a hundred noteworthy incidents.
They rented a tiny cottage of
three rooms in the unfashionable part of
the town where rents were low. Here
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
was a bit of ground all about, and a narrow
porch that looked straight into the face
of the splendid old Peak; and here they
lived the merriest of lives on the smallest
and most precarious of incomes; for they
were determined to infringe as little as
possible upon the slender capital, snugly
stowed away in a Colorado bank.</p>
<p>Dan soon found employment in a
livery-stable at fifty cents a day. His
chief business was the agreeable one of
delivering &#8220;teams&#8221; and saddle-horses to
pleasure-seekers at the north end of the
town, riding back to the stable again on a
&#8220;led horse&#8221; provided for the purpose. If
not a very ambitious calling, it was, at
least, exceedingly good fun, and it also
had the merit of conforming to the doctor&#8217;s
directions. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let him get
behind a counter or into any stuffy back-office,&#8221;
the doctor had said to Polly.
&#8220;Whatever he does, let it keep him in
the open air as much as possible.&#8221; Had
the very obvious wisdom of this advice
required demonstration, Dan&#8217;s rapid improvement
would have been sufficient.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></p>
<p>They did not shock the sensibilities of
the sewing-circle by writing home exactly
what the employment was that Dan had
found, while, for themselves, Polly had her
own little ways of embellishing the somewhat
prosaic situation. She dubbed the
young stable-boy Hercules, and always
spoke of the establishment he served as
&#8220;The Aug&aelig;ans.&#8221; Nor did her invention
fail when, a month or two later, Dan got
a place at somewhat higher wages as
druggist&#8217;s messenger; for then he was
promptly informed that his name was
Mercury, and that there were wings on
his heels, though he could not himself see
them, by reason of their being turned
back, and visible only when his feet were
in rapid motion!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Polly, too, was doing her
part, though it had not yet proved very
lucrative. When they first took the house,
Dan painted a sign for her, bearing the
following announcement:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:0.0em; text-align:center'><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Fine Needlework and Embroidery to Order</span>.<br /></p>
<p>But the spring and summer went by, and
autumn came, and still the sign which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
had ornamented their house-front for
so many months had as yet attracted
the notice of only the impecunious class
of customers their immediate neighbourhood
afforded. Polly had gratefully
taken coarse work at low prices, but
she still hoped for better things. The
street where their tiny cottage stood,
though at the wrong end of the town, was
a thoroughfare for pleasure parties driving
to the great ca&ntilde;ons, and Polly never saw
the approach of a pretty turnout without
a thrill of hope that the occupants might
be attracted by her sign. She knew herself
to be a quick and skilful needlewoman,
and she thought that if only she
might once get started in well-paid work,
Dan, who was growing stronger every
day, might go on with his education at
the Colorado College Preparatory School.
She had found out all about the college,
of which she had formed a very high
opinion, and she told herself proudly that
Dan had such a good mind that he would
not need to study too hard.</p>
<p>One evening in September they were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
clearing the supper table, preparatory to
washing up the dishes, which ceremony
was one of the numerous &#8220;larks&#8221; by which
brother and sister found life diversified
and enlivened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mercury, I have an idea!&#8221; Polly suddenly
cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never saw the time you hadn&#8217;t,
Polly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But this is a great idea, a really great
one, because it includes all the little ones,
like Milton&#8217;s universe in the crescent
moon; don&#8217;t you remember?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My goody, Polly! But it must be a
corker!&#8221;&mdash;and Dan was all attention.</p>
<p>Now Polly, it is needless to repeat, was
a young person of ideas; that was her
strong point, and Dan at least considered
her a marvel of ingenuity and invention.
Their tiny sitting-room, where Dan slept,
was a witness to her taste and originality.
There were picturesque shelves which Dan
had made in accordance with her directions;
there were cheesecloth window-curtains,
with rustic boughs in place of
poles; there were barrels standing bottom
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
upward for tables, draped with ancient
&#8220;duds&#8221;&mdash;a changeable-silk skirt of her
mother&#8217;s over one, a moth-eaten camel&#8217;s-hair
shawl over another. The crack in
the only mirror which a munificent landlord
had provided was concealed by a
kinikinick vine; a piece of Turkey-red at
five cents a yard, their one bit of extravagance,
converted Dan&#8217;s cot-bed into a
canopy of state. And having heard Dan
chant the praises of her &#8220;ideas&#8221; with
gratifying persistence for a month past,
Polly had begun to wonder whether they
might not be turned to account.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the latest idea, Polly?&#8221; Dan
asked, seizing a dripping handful of what
they were pleased to call their &#8220;family
plate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Dan, I want you to paint something
more on my sign. Only two words;
it won&#8217;t take you long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What two words?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Also Ideas!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>Dan reflected a moment, and then he
proceeded to dance a jig of delight, wildly
waving his dish-cloth about Polly&#8217;s head.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Polly, you beat the world!&#8221; he cried.</p>
<p>A house-painter lived next door, from
whom Dan borrowed paint and brushes,
and before they slept the old sign was
further decorated with two magic words
done in brilliant scarlet. The inscription
now read:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:0.0em; text-align:center'><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Fine Needlework and Embroidery to Order</span>.<br />
<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Also Ideas</span><br /></p>
<p>There was something positively dazzling
about those two words in flaming scarlet,
and Polly and Dan stepped out twice in
the course of their early breakfast to have
a look at them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you feel scared, Polly?&#8221; asked
Dan, as he left her at her dish-washing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Scared? Not I!&#8221; and she walked
down the path with him, drying her hands
on a dish-towel.</p>
<p>It was a delicious morning in late September;
the air dry and sparkling as a
jewel, the mountains baring their shoulders
to the morning sun. The Peak had already
a dash of winter on his crown, but
the barren slope of rock below looked like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
an impregnable fortress. Polly and Dan
were never tired of wondering at the
changing moods that played so gloriously
upon that steadfast front.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems as if they must almost see him
from Fieldham this morning, he&#8217;s so
bright,&#8221; said Polly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; Dan agreed. &#8220;I say,
Polly, isn&#8217;t he enjoying himself, though?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Course he is!&#8221; Polly answered.
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t everybody?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Polly went back to her splashing
water and flopping dish-towels, and was
busy for an hour about the house. By
and bye she sat herself down in the little
porch and proceeded to put good honest
stitches into a child&#8217;s frock, for the making
of which she was to receive twenty-five
cents. Not very good pay for a day&#8217;s
work, but &#8220;twenty-five-hundred-million
per cent. better than nothing,&#8221; as she had
assured the doubtful Dan.</p>
<p>Life looked very different to her since
those two bright words had been added
to the sign. Not that it had looked otherwise
than pleasant before; but there was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
so little originality in the idea of doing
needlework that it had scarcely merited
success, while this,&mdash;of course it must
succeed!</p>
<p>In truth, she had sat there hardly an hour,
when she distinctly heard the occupant
of a yellow buckboard read the sign, and
then turn to her companion with a word
of comment. Polly had always had an
idea that one of those yellow buckboards
would be the making of her fortune yet.
The one in question was drawn by a
pretty pair of ponies, and two young girls
were in possession of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have an idea they&#8217;ll notice it again,
when they come back this way,&#8221; Polly
surmised. &#8220;But if they&#8217;re going up the
ca&ntilde;on they won&#8217;t come back till just as
I&#8217;m getting dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, sure enough, the mutton stew
was just beginning to simmer, when there
came a rap at the door.</p>
<p>The front door opened directly into the
little sitting-room, and was never closed
in pleasant weather. As Polly emerged
from the kitchen, her face very red from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
hobnobbing with the stove, she found one
of the girls of the yellow buckboard standing
in the doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, Miss&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fitch. My name is Polly Fitch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What a jolly name!&#8221; the visitor exclaimed.
&#8220;I think you must be the one
with ideas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Polly, &#8220;Do you want
one? Come in and take a seat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do want an idea most dreadfully,&#8221;
the young lady rejoined, taking the proffered
chair. &#8220;I want something for a
booby prize for a backgammon tournament.
I don&#8217;t suppose anybody ever
heard of a backgammon tournament before,
but it&#8217;s going to be great fun. We
are doing it to take the conceit out of a
young man we know, who declares that
there&#8217;s nothing in backgammon that he
didn&#8217;t learn the first time he played it
with his grandfather.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you want a booby prize?&#8221; Polly
looked thoughtful for the space of sixteen
seconds. Then she cried; &#8220;Oh, I have
an idea! Get somebody to whittle you a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
couple of wooden dice; then paint them
white and mark them with black sixes on
each of the six sides of each die. You
could call it &#8216;<i>a booby pair-o&#8217;-dice</i>&#8217; if you
don&#8217;t object to puns!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What a good idea! It&#8217;s simply perfect!
I wonder whom I could get to do
it for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Dan could do it with his jackknife,
just as well as not. If you&#8217;ll come
to-morrow morning you shall have them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Accordingly, the next morning, the
young lady appeared, and was enchanted
with her prize.</p>
<p>&#8220;And how much will they be?&#8221; she
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I had thought of charging
twenty-five cents for an idea, and the dice
didn&#8217;t cost us anything and only took a
few minutes to make.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Supposing we call it a dollar. Would
that be fair?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe they are worth a
dollar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they are; I should be ashamed
to take them for less. What a splendid
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
idea that was of yours, to put out that
sign!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think it was, if I could get
any more customers like you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll send them to you,&mdash;never you
fear!&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Beatrice Compton returned to her
buckboard a captive to Polly.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s the sweetest thing,&#8221; she told her
mother, who chanced to be her passenger
on this occasion. &#8220;She&#8217;s got eyes and
hair exactly of a colour, a sort of reddish
brown, and her eyes twinkle at you in the
dearest way, and she wears her hair in
the quaintest pug, just in the right place
on her head, sort of up in the air; and
she&#8217;s a lady, too; anybody can see that.
I wonder who &#8216;Dan&#8217; is; you don&#8217;t suppose
she&#8217;s married, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t tell,&#8221; Mrs. Compton replied.
&#8220;Persons in that walk of life marry
very young.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Mamma, she isn&#8217;t a &#8216;person,&#8217; and
she doesn&#8217;t belong to &#8216;that walk of life.&#8217;
She&#8217;s a lady.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Beatrice was as good as her word,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
and three days had not passed when a
horseman stopped before the little cottage,
sprang from his horse, and looked
about for a place to tie; there was no
hitching-post near by. Polly was sitting
in the porch making buttonholes.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you were coming in here, you&#8217;d
better lead him right up the walk,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;and tie him to the porch-post.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good idea!&#8221; the young man
replied, promptly acting upon the advice.
&#8220;You are Miss Polly Fitch, are you not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew you the minute I saw you,
because Miss Compton described you to
me.&#8221; This was meant to be very flattering,
but Polly, who seldom missed a point, was
quite unconscious that one had been made.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you come for an idea?&#8221; she
asked, quite innocently, and Mr. Reginald
Axton, who was rather sensitive, wondered
whether she &#8220;meant anything.&#8221;
On second thoughts he concluded that
she did not, and he began again:</p>
<p>&#8220;I got that booby prize you made.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you?&#8221; cried Polly, with animation.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
&#8220;Oh, I wonder whether you were
the one&mdash;&#8221; she paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;The one that what?&#8221; he asked hastily.</p>
<p>&#8220;The one that thought there wasn&#8217;t
anything in the game.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, yes, I was. And the others
had all the luck, and so of course I got
beaten.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course!&#8221; said Polly, with a twinkle
of delight.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see you&#8217;re on their side, but all the
same I want you to help me to pay them
back. You see I wanted to do something
about it, and I thought of sending Miss
Compton some flowers with a verse, and I
thought perhaps you could do the verse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you expect me to furnish the idea,
too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, of course! That&#8217;s why I came
to you. I thought, if you were so awfully
bright, perhaps you could make verses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly looked thoughtful.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should charge you quite a lot for it,&#8221;
she said,&mdash;&#8220;much as a dollar perhaps;
for you know writing verses is quite an
accomplishment.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll pay a dollar a line for it! I know
a fellow that gets more than that from the
magazines. And I&#8217;m sure that it will be
good if you do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My gracious! that&#8217;s great pay!&#8221; cried
Polly, with sparkling eyes, ignoring the
compliment, but enchanted to hear what
a price verses brought. &#8220;I&#8217;ll send it to
you by mail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I guess I&#8217;ll look in every once in
a while and see how you&#8217;re getting on!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me!&#8221; said Polly, &#8220;you don&#8217;t
expect me to spend a week over it, do
you? That isn&#8217;t why you offered such
high pay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no; the quicker you got it done
the more I should be willing to pay for
it.&#8221; He paused a moment. &#8220;And, Miss
Fitch,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;I don&#8217;t care if you
make it a little,&mdash;well,&mdash;a little soft. She
deserves it, she&#8217;s such a tease! Her
name&#8217;s Beatrice,&#8221; he added. &#8220;We call
her Trix, if that&#8217;ll help you any.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly understood Mr. Reginald perfectly,
and she dismissed him with a twinkle
which promised well. Then Polly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
proceeded to cudgel her brain, while the
needle went in and out, and a buttonhole
formed itself in the firm, narrow line that
makes of a buttonhole a work of art.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I could rhyme words as well as
I can stitches,&#8221; Polly thought to herself, as
she held up a completed buttonhole, with
the honest pride of a good workman.
&#8220;Sixes,&mdash;Trixes! that heart were Trix&#8217;s!
That ought to be made to go. A double
rhyme, too! I don&#8217;t believe he expects a
double rhyme.&#8221; And in and out and
in and out her thoughts plied themselves
round and about the two words, and her
cheeks got quite hot with the pleasurable
excitement of this new mental exercise.</p>
<p>At last she tossed down her work, and,
fetching a piece of brown wrapping-paper,
proceeded, with many erasures and tinkerings,
to inscribe upon it the following
verse:</p>
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>
<p style='margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;'>
Were hearts the dice and love the game,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1.5625em;'>Of no avail were double sixes;</span><br />
On every heart is but one name,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1.5625em;'>We nought could throw but <i>double-Trixes!</i></span></p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>&#8220;Rather neat,&#8221; said Polly to herself,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
&#8220;rather neat! Now if he were to send
it with two bunches of roses of six each, I
think it could not fail to make an impression.
I should rather hate to pay
another person to make love for me,
though,&#8221; she went on, with a little toss
of the head; and then she picked up her
work and began again to &#8220;rhyme buttonholes.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Dan came home to supper he
had much to learn. He was lost in wonder
over the rhyme which Polly repeated
to him, but still more impressed by the
four great silver dollars she had to show;
for her impatient customer had already
called for the verses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jiminy!&#8221; cried Dan; &#8220;that&#8217;s most a
week&#8217;s earnings for some of us!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Polly replied, demurely; &#8220;that&#8217;s
what Mrs. O&#8217;Toole would have paid me
for sixteen baby-dresses. Things even
themselves out in the long run, don&#8217;t they,
Dan?&#8221; As though Polly knew anything
about the long run, by the way!</p>
<p>Before Christmas Polly was driving a
pretty trade, not only in ideas but in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
sewing. She had in all ten dozen pocket
handkerchiefs to mark for Christmas
customers, besides towels and table-linen,
sheets and pillow-cases. People had
found her out, and she had to refuse more
than one good order for lack of time.
But needlework alone, quick as she was
in doing it, would have given her but a
meagre income, had she not been able to
furnish &#8220;also ideas.&#8221;</p>
<p>One lady, for instance, came to ask her
for an &#8220;idea&#8221; for a Thanksgiving dinner,
and Polly not only suggested the idea, but
carried it out for her. She went about
with a big basket to all the markets and
collected perfect specimens of vegetables
with which to make a centrepiece for the
dinner table. The dinner was given in a
house where the round dining table would
seat twenty-four guests. In this ample
centre she erected a pyramid of fruits of
the earth. There were crimson beets,
pale yellow squashes, scarlet tomatoes,
and the long, thin fingers of the string-bean;
potatoes furnished a comfortable
brown, which, together with the soft
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
bronze of the onion, harmonized discordant
colours; and, crowning all, the silken tassel
of the red-eared corn raised its graceful
crest.</p>
<p>The hostess was delighted with her
table, and more delighted still with the
pretty decorator. Polly&#8217;s fame flew from
one to another throughout that kindly and
prosperous community, and she found herself
accumulating a goodly hoard. As
Christmas drew near, many a perplexed
shopper came to her for &#8220;ideas,&#8221; and all
went away content. She had long since
discovered that the Colorado shops were
treasure-houses of pretty things. She
never passed a jeweller&#8217;s window without
taking note of his latest novelties; she
kept an eye upon Mexican and Indian
bazaars, and Chinese bric-&agrave;-brac collections;
she made a study of Colorado gems,
and knew where the prizes lay hidden;
she ran through the books in the bookstores;
she was alert for new inventions
in harness decoration and bridle trimmings;
she gave hints for fancy-work of
divers kinds.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></p>
<p>Mercury, meanwhile, sped about the
town, dispensing healing, as Polly often
reminded him, and &#8220;getting more than I
dispense, Polly,&#8221; he would declare in return.
&#8220;I feel so well that everything is
a regular lark!&#8221;</p>
<p>And so Dan made a &#8220;lark&#8221; of his work,
and trotted all day in his capacity of Mercury,
little dreaming of the wealth that
was accumulating for his use; while Polly
went on with her hoarding, of which she
made a great secret, and thought of a still
better time coming.</p>

<p class='tp' style='font-size:1.2em;margin-bottom:20px;'>CHAPTER III</p>
<p class='tp' style='font-size:1em;margin-bottom:30px;'>A MERRY CHRISTMAS</p>
<p>Of all Polly&#8217;s new friends, not one took
a warmer interest in the young
idea-vendor than that first customer of
hers, Miss Beatrice Compton. Miss Beatrice
was a warm-hearted and enthusiastic
girl, who never did anything by halves;
and when she talked of Polly, of Polly&#8217;s
skill and of Polly&#8217;s originality, when she
extolled Polly&#8217;s eyes and Polly&#8217;s hair,
Polly&#8217;s wit and Polly&#8217;s sweetness, few listeners
remained quite unmoved and incurious.
Among the many who were
thus stirred to seek out this youthful paragon,
was Miss Compton&#8217;s brother-in-law,
Mr. Horace Clapp. Nor was an idle curiosity
his only motive in taking the step.
Beneath the pretext he found for paying
the visit lurked a rather shamefaced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
purpose of doing this &#8220;plucky little
genius&#8221; a good turn.</p>
<p>It happened, therefore, one morning in
December, that Polly came home from
her marketing to find a stranger sitting
in her porch. A dog-cart, driven by a
groom in livery, was passing and repassing
her door; and one look at the occupant
of the porch sufficed to fix the connection
between the two. He was a well-dressed
man of thirty or more, who rose as she
opened the gate and saluted her as if she
had been a duchess.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Polly Fitch?&#8221; he inquired, as he
stood before her, hat in hand.</p>
<p>It was noticeable that no one ever
omitted the &#8220;Polly&#8221; from the girl&#8217;s name.
It seemed as much a part of her as the
ruddy hair and the dimple in her chin.
That dimple, by the way, should have
been mentioned long ago; but that, in its
turn, was so essential a feature, that one
would as soon think it necessary to state
that Polly&#8217;s nose had an upward tilt as
that her chin had a dimple. Any one
who had ever heard of Polly must know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
that her nose would tilt and her chin have
a dimple.</p>
<p>Polly had a large market-basket on her
arm, and as she felt in her pocket for the
key to the front door, her visitor took
possession of the basket. She was a good
deal impressed by the attention from so
magnificent a personage, and one, moreover,
of advanced years. She began to
think that she must be mistaken about his
being thirty; why, that was Cousin John&#8217;s
age, and Cousin John was quite an oldish
man. She motioned her visitor to enter,
and it must be admitted that there was
no oppressive reverence in her tone as
she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;If you would tell me <i>your</i> name, now
we should be starting fair!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Horace Clapp. Did you
ever hear of me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think so. Ought I to
have?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, no, there&#8217;s no obligation in the
matter. I only had an idea that I was a
local celebrity, like you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like me?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes! You&#8217;re a surprise to the town
and so am I.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you done to surprise the
town?&#8221; asked Polly, filled with curiosity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve only got rich very fast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, so have I!&#8221; said Polly. &#8220;We
<i>are</i> a good deal alike.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Really? Then you will be in an even
better position to advise me than I thought
for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>supposed</i> you had come for an idea,&#8221;
said Polly, as naturally as if her wares had
consisted in tape and buttons.</p>
<p>Offering her visitor the only fairly comfortable
chair in the room, she seated herself
by the window, near which was one of
the draped barrels with her work-basket
on top.</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t mind my sewing, please,&#8221;
she said, picking up a bit of embroidery;
&#8220;I can think better that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new customer meanwhile was wondering
whether Miss Polly would guess
that he had come partly from curiosity,
and partly with that other far more daring
motive of finding a way to do her a service.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
And yet, who could tell? Perhaps
she <i>could</i> give him a hint; perhaps she
<i>was</i> the youthful sibyl people seemed half
inclined to believe her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Polly,&#8221; he said, leaning forward
in his chair, with his elbows on his knees,&mdash;&#8220;Miss
Polly, I&#8217;ve got an awful lot of
money, and I don&#8217;t know what to do with
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mere words had not often the power of
staying Polly&#8217;s needle, but at this astounding
declaration she actually let her work
fall in her lap, and gazed with wide-eyed
wonder at the speaker.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;I really want to do
some good with it, and I&#8217;ve tried in lots
of ways and I&#8217;ve never hit it off. I
should just like to tell you about some
of the things I&#8217;ve made a fizzle of in the
last year,&mdash;if it wouldn&#8217;t bore you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, it wouldn&#8217;t bore me; nothing
ever does. Only,&mdash;I can&#8217;t understand it.
Why, I think I could give away <i>a thousand
dollars a year</i> just there at home, where
we used to live, and every dollar of it
would be well spent!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Miss Polly,&#8221; he said very meekly,
&#8220;but, you see, what I&#8217;ve got to consider
is <i>two hundred thousand</i> dollars a year!&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked positively ashamed of himself,
and Polly did not wonder. She had
given a little gasp at mention of the sum;
then she shook her head with decision.
Polly knew her limits.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t any ideas big enough for
that&#8221; she said. &#8220;I should as soon think
of advising the President of the United
States!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if you won&#8217;t advise me about
mine, perhaps you will tell me what you
are going to do with your own riches.
You said you were getting rich, did you
not? You know,&#8221; he added, &#8220;it isn&#8217;t
necessary to make the map of a State as
big as the State itself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have ideas, too,&#8221; Polly remarked
appreciatively, resuming her embroidery.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you have not told me how you
are going to use your riches.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m going to use mine for education.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Going up to the college?&#8221; he asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no; there&#8217;d be no good in my
knowing a lot. I&#8217;ve been nearly through
the Fieldham High School already, and
the little that I&#8217;ve learned doesn&#8217;t seem
to stick very well. No, indeed! I&#8217;m
going to&mdash;&#8221; she paused with a feeling of
loyalty to Dan&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;m only going to help
on the general cause of education,&#8221; she
finished demurely.</p>
<p>As she made this sphinx-like remark,
Mr. Horace Clapp wished she would relinquish
the pursuit of wealth long enough
to put her work down and let him see
exactly what she meant.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that is the best use to put
money to,&#8221; he said gravely, &#8220;but I&#8217;m not
in the way of knowing about people who
need help. Couldn&#8217;t you tell me of somebody,
some young man who wanted to go
to college, or some girl who would like to
go abroad? Of course, I could found a
scholarship, or endow a &#8216;chair,&#8217; but one
likes a bit of the personal element in one&#8217;s
work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly&#8217;s heart gave a thump. Here was
a chance for Dan; a word from her was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
all that was needed to make his path an
easy one. Had she a right to withhold
that word,&mdash;to cramp and hinder him?
She did not speak for a good many seconds;
she simply plied her needle with
more and more diligence, while her breath
came fast and unevenly. Suddenly a furious
blush went mounting up into her temples
and spread itself down her neck. Her
visitor thought he had never seen any one
blush like that, and it somehow struck
him that his little plan was swamped.
Quite right he was, too. Polly blushed to
think that she had thought of Dan in
such a connection for a single instant.</p>
<p>It was very unreasoning, this impulse
of rebellious shame: are we not admonished
to help one another? And what
could the helpers do if all their benefactions
were indignantly thrust back? Very
unreasoning indeed, but natural!&mdash;natural
as the colour of her hair and the quickness
of her wit, natural as all the graces and
virtues, all the misconceptions and foibles,
that went to make up the personality of
Polly Fitch,&mdash;of Polly Fitch, the daughter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
of Puritan ancestors; men and women
who could starve, body and mind, but who
never had learned to accept a charity.</p>
<p>Before the flush had died away, Polly
was quite herself again, and looked up so
brightly and sweetly that Mr. Clapp took
heart of hope.</p>
<p>&#8220;You do know somebody like that;
I&#8217;m sure you do!&#8221; he said insinuatingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I?&#8221; said Polly. &#8220;I know hardly anybody.
But I&#8217;m sure the president of the
college could tell you of a dozen boys who
would be grateful for help.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so Mr. Horace Clapp&#8217;s little plan
had come to nought, and he took his
leave more than ever convinced that it is
a very difficult thing to spend one&#8217;s money
in a good cause. As he stood a moment,
waiting for his dog-cart, a boy came down
the street with a parcel under his arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Mister, do you know whether
Daniel Fitch lives here?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Daniel Fitch?&#8221; thought Mr. Clapp, as
the boy turned in at the gate. &#8220;Daniel
Fitch? Where have I heard that name?
Oh, yes, Beatrice said there was a brother;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
runs errands for Jones, the druggist.
Plucky children! It would be pleasant to
give them a lift!&#8221;</p>
<p>As for Polly, she had not a twinge of
regret. In fact, she rather enjoyed dwelling
upon the splendour of the opportunity
she had thrust from her, the better to
glory in her escape. And she looked forward
with entire confidence to the time
when she should test Dan&#8217;s feeling on the
point.</p>
<p>On Christmas Eve they hung up their
stockings, fairly bulging with materialised
jokes and ideas which the morning was to
bring to light, and we may be sure that
they did not wait for the lazy winter sun to
put in an appearance before beginning
their investigations. Amid shouts of merriment
the revelations of a remarkably inventive
Santa Claus were greeted, while
Polly held her climbing excitement in
check until the hour should be ripe for
greater things. But when, at last, just as
the sun was peeping in at the kitchen window,
Dan&#8217;s ferret fingers penetrated the
extreme toe of his sock, she grew so agitated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
that she quite forgot to make a certain
witty observation she had been saving
up for that particular moment. And so
it came about that an unwonted silence
reigned as the unsuspecting Dan drew
forth a small flat parcel labelled: &#8220;A
Merry Christmas from Polly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Within was their familiar bank-book,
wrapped about with a less familiar sheet
of note-paper bearing the following inscription:</p>
<p>&#8220;An Idea! Namely, to wit: That
Daniel Reddiman Fitch, Esq., lay aside
his character of Mercury, and become a
student at Colorado College!</p>
<p>&#8220;P. S.&mdash;An examination of the within
balance will assure the said Dan that there
is nothing to prevent his thus delighting
the heart of his faithful Polly.&#8221;</p>
<p>A glance at the balance recorded, a reperusal
of the &#8220;idea,&#8221; and the impressive
silence was broken into a thousand fragments.</p>
<p>&#8220;For you see, Dan,&#8221; Polly explained,
when, at last, she had secured a hearing,
&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t know what in the world to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
do with so much money,&mdash;some rich people
don&#8217;t, they say,&mdash;and I&#8217;ve got plenty
of ideas to last us for years to come.
Then, just as they begin to give out,
you&#8217;ll have got to be a mining engineer,
with your pockets cram-full of money, and
you&#8217;ll have to support me for the rest
of my life. So I don&#8217;t see but that I&#8217;m
getting the best of the bargain, after
all!&#8221;</p>
<p>It all seemed perfectly natural to Dan.
This sister of his had always lent a hand
when he needed it. Of course he would
accept her help, and let the future, the
glorious, inexhaustible future straighten
out the account between them. He did
not express himself even in his inmost
thoughts in any such high-flown manner
as this. He simply gave an Indian war-whoop,
administered to Polly a portentous
hug, and declared for the hundredth time,
&#8220;Polly, you <i>beat the world!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>When everything was thus amicably
settled and Dan had agreed to &#8220;give notice&#8221;
in his capacity as Mercury, the following
day, Polly said: &#8220;You won&#8217;t mind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
being poor, will you, Dan? You don&#8217;t
wish we were rich, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rich? Why, we <i>are</i> rich!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Dan, if any one came along and
offered you a lot of money, say a thousand
dollars a year, you wouldn&#8217;t take it, would
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean a stranger, Polly, some
one we hadn&#8217;t any claim on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; but somebody who had such
a lot he wouldn&#8217;t miss it. Would you
take it, Dan? Say, would you take it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What a goose you are, Polly! Of
course I wouldn&#8217;t take it! I would rather
go back to the Aug&aelig;ans for the rest of my
life!&#8221;</p>
<p>On the evening of that momentous
Christmas Day, our two young people had
out their Latin books and began industriously
to polish up their somewhat rusty
acquirements in that classic tongue. A
year ago they might not have regarded
this as precisely a holiday pastime, but
their ideas had undergone a great change
since then.</p>
<p>They sat at the little centre-table, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
ruddy head and the black one close together
in the lamp-light, reading their
Cicero. A rap at the door seemed a rude
interruption; yet so unusual was the excitement
of an evening visitor that they
could not be quite indifferent to the event,&mdash;the
less so when the visitor proved
to be Polly&#8217;s client of the cumbrous
income.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good evening, Miss Polly,&#8221; he called,
from the door, and Polly fancied that his
voice had a particularly cheerful ring in it.
As he spoke, he glanced at Dan, who had
opened the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is my brother, Dan. Won&#8217;t you
come in, Mr. Clapp?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With all the pleasure in the world, for
I have come in the character of Santa
Claus.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you indeed?&#8221; thought Polly to
herself; &#8220;we&#8217;ll see about that!&#8221; Perhaps
there was something in her manner
that betrayed her thoughts, for her visitor
said, with evident amusement:</p>
<p>&#8220;You take alarm too easily, Miss Polly.
I should as soon think of offering a gift in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
my own name to,&mdash;to any other extremely
rich young woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was glad to hear that your brother&#8217;s
name was Dan,&#8221; he continued with apparent
irrelevance, as he took his seat. &#8220;And
more delighted still when I found out
his middle name. Didn&#8217;t it strike you,&#8221;
he asked, turning abruptly to Dan, &#8220;that
your employer, Mr. Jones, was developing
rather a sudden interest in your
antecedents?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Polly thought, &#8220;he is pleased
about something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; Dan answered, with boyish
bluntness. &#8220;But what do you know
about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only that it was I that put Jones up
to making his inquiries.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You?&#8221; Dan looked half inclined to
resent the liberty. But Polly saw that
there was something coming.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you mind telling us what it&#8217;s
all about?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;You look as if
you knew something nice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do; it&#8217;s one of the nicest things I
ever knew in my life. I didn&#8217;t tell you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
the other day, did I, that I had made
most of my money in mines?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Polly, wondering why he
should want to tell them how he made
&#8220;his old money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that is the case; nearly all in
one mine, too. It&#8217;s a great placer mine
up north. I don&#8217;t suppose you know
much about placer mines?&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly, disclaiming such knowledge, tried
to look politely interested, while Dan&#8217;s
interest, fortunately for his manners, was
very genuine. Was he not to be a mining
engineer, and did he not want to learn
all he could?</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Mr. Clapp went on, &#8220;a placer
mine is one where the gold lies embedded
in the soil and has to be washed out, and if
there doesn&#8217;t happen to be running water
near by it costs an awful lot to bring it in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the polite Polly, with a
vision of a fire-brigade running about with
buckets in their hands, as they used to do
in Fieldham.</p>
<p>&#8220;What they call hydraulic mining,&#8221;
Dan put in.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s it. Big ditches to be dug,
and all that sort of thing. Well, this
&#8216;Big Bonus Mine&#8217; was discovered twenty
years ago. A company was started and
the stock was put on the market at a
dollar a share. The management made a
mess of it, as a management usually does,
and it fizzled out. It was believed that
the thing was chock-full of gold, but they
couldn&#8217;t get it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly was beginning to be interested;
she usually did find things interesting
when she gave her mind to them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what did they do?&#8221; asked Dan.</p>
<p>&#8220;They gave it up for a bad job, and
tried to forget all the money they had
put into it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then where did your money come
from?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Out of the &#8216;Big Bonus Placer Gold
Mine!&#8217; We scoop it right out to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you&#8217;d go ahead!&#8221; said Dan,
for the guest had paused, and was examining
the <i>Cicero</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, hydraulic mining improves, like
every thing else, and three years ago a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
new company was formed. Luckily the
old company had not gone into debt;
perhaps they could not borrow money on
their elephant. However that may be,
they agreed to put half their stock back
into the treasury, and it was sold at fifty
cents a share, which gave us money to
work with.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And it was a howling success!&#8221; cried
Dan. &#8220;I remember; I&#8217;ve heard all
about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we&#8217;ve paid out two dollars a
share in dividends in the last six months,
and the stock is held at fifteen or sixteen
dollars a share to-day. The beauty of it
is,&#8221; Mr. Horace Clapp added, glancing
quietly from Dan to Polly, &#8220;I am convinced
that you are both stockholders.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We?&#8221; they cried in a breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes! For Jones tells me that your
father was a doctor; that his name was
Daniel Reddiman Fitch, and that he once
lived in Bington, Ohio.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Polly; &#8220;that was when
he was first married; before old Doctor
Royce died, and left an opening in Fieldham,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
so that Father came back home
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The name of such a stockholder
stands on our books, but we haven&#8217;t
heretofore been able to trace him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why old Jones pumped me
so,&#8221; Dan remarked, giving his mind first
to the more familiar aspects of the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a pity he never knew!&#8221; said
Polly, with glistening eyes. &#8220;He was
always so poor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father&#8217;s original holdings were
five thousand shares, so that you are the
possessors of twenty-five hundred shares.
If you sell it pretty soon, as I think you
may as well do, you will have something
over forty thousand dollars to invest; for
there is, in addition to the stock, five
thousand dollars in back dividends due
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dan and Polly looked at each other
almost aghast; but that was only for a
moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Dan, you can have a saddle-horse
of your own!&#8221; cried Polly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And so can you!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And we can&mdash;O Mr. Clapp, how
rude we are!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Clapp looked as if it were a kind
of rudeness that he was enjoying very
much. As he rose to go, he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think I&#8217;m a pretty good
sort of a Santa Claus after all, Miss Polly?&#8221;</p>
<p>Polly seized his outstretched hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t believe any one person could
be so rich, and so good, too!&#8221; she declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;And, O Dan!&#8221; cried Polly, the minute
they were alone together, &#8220;let&#8217;s send a
New-Year&#8217;s box home. There&#8217;ll be just
time enough. We can get one of those
great carriage rugs for Uncle Seth, and
a China silk for Aunt Lucia.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll send Cousin John&#8217;s boys
some Indian bows and arrows.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Cousin Martha a dozen Chinese
cups and saucers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the old Professor a meerschaum
pipe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Miss Louisa Bailey, and dear
Mrs. Dodge, and the Widow Criswell,&mdash;what
<i>shall</i> we send the Widow Criswell,
Dan?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Some black-bordered pocket-handkerchiefs!&#8221;
cried the irreverent Dan.</p>
<p>Before going to bed they stepped out
on the porch to bid the Peak good-night.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to be a fine day to-morrow,
Polly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All the days are fine in Colorado,&#8221; said
Polly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You forget the blizzard last month.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but it was <i>such a dear blizzard</i>
not to do you any harm when it caught
you out!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dan grew thoughtful.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you ever think, Polly, that we
should never have come out here if it
hadn&#8217;t been for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know it was &#8216;Pike&#8217;s Peak or
bust!&#8217; with both of us, Dan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dan looked critically from the great
Peak, gleaming there in the starlight, to
Polly&#8217;s uplifted face, and then, as they
turned to go in, he exclaimed, for the
hundred-and-first time:</p>
<p>&#8220;Polly, <i>you beat the world!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p class='tp' style='font-size:1em;margin-bottom:30px;'>NANNIE&#8217;S THEATRE PARTY</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, my dear, I went to the the<i>ett</i>er
myself once when I was quite a
girl, younger &#8217;n you be, I guess. &#8217;Twas
Uncle &#8217;Bijah Lane that took me, &#8217;n&#8217; he was
so upsot by their hevin&#8217; a fun&#8217;ral all acted
out on the stage, that he come home and
told Ma &#8217;twa&#8217;n&#8217;t no fit place for young
girls to go to, &#8217;n&#8217; I ain&#8217;t never ben inside
a the<i>ett</i>er sence. Doos seem good to see
play-actin&#8217; agin after all these years, I declare
it doos!&#8221;&mdash;and Miss Becky took up
her sewing, which she had laid down in a
moment of enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you liked it half as well as I like
to do it, Miss Becky, you&#8217;d like it even
better than you do now,&#8221; replied Lady
Macbeth, with a cheerful gusto, somewhat
at odds with her tragic character.</p>
<p>Nannie Ray, herself still very new to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
the delights of theatre-going, had recently
seen a great actress play Lady
Macbeth, and, fired with the spirit of
emulation, she had been enacting the
sleep-walking scene for the benefit of her
country neighbour. Miss Becky Crawlin
lived only half a mile down the road from
the old Ray homestead, where the family
were in the habit of spending six months
of the year. She and Nannie had always
been great cronies, Miss Becky finding
a perennial delight in &#8220;that child&#8217;s
goin&#8217;s on.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;child&#8221; meanwhile had come to
be sixteen years old, but no one would
have given her credit for such dignity who
had seen the incongruous little figure
perched upon the slippery haircloth sofa,
twinkling with delight at Miss Becky&#8217;s
encomiums. She wore a voluminous
nightgown, from under the hem of which
a pink gingham ruffle insisted upon poking
itself out; her long black hair hung over
her shoulders in sufficiently tragic strands;
her cheeks, liberally powdered with flour,
gleamed treacherously pink through a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
chance break in their highly artificial pallor,
while portentous brows of burnt cork
did their best to make terrible a pair of
very girlish and innocent eyes. A touch
of realism which the original Lady Macbeth
lacked was given by a streak of red
crayon which lent a murderous significance
to the small brown hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I declare!&#8221; her admiring auditor went
on, stitching away to make up for lost
time, &#8220;I can&#8217;t see but you do&#8217;s well&#8217;s
the lady I saw&mdash;only she was dressed
prettier, and went round with a wreath on
her head. A wreath&#8217;s always so becomin&#8217;!
We used to wear &#8217;em May Day, when I
was a girl. They was made o&#8217; paper
flowers, all colours, so&#8217;s you could suit
your complexion, and when it didn&#8217;t rain
I must say we looked reel nice. &#8217;Twas
surprisin&#8217;, though, how quick a few drops
o&#8217; rain would wilt one o&#8217; them paper
wreaths right down so&#8217;s you could scurcely
tell what &#8217;twas meant for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me some more about the girl
with the wreath, Miss Becky,&#8221; said Lady
Macbeth, longing to curl herself up in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
corner, but too mindful of her tragic dignity
to unbend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, she looked reel pretty, but she
didn&#8217;t hev <i>sperit</i> enough to suit my idees.
She was kind o&#8217; lackadaisical and namby-pamby,
&#8217;n&#8217; when her young man sarsed her
she didn&#8217;t seem to hev nothin&#8217; to say for
herself. I must say &#8217;twas a heathenish
kind of a play anyway, &#8217;n&#8217; I ain&#8217;t surprised
that Uncle &#8217;Bijah got sot agin it.
The language wa&#8217;n&#8217;t sech as I&#8217;d ben
brought up to, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lady Macbeth had leaned forward and
was clasping her knees, thus unconsciously
widening the expanse of pink
gingham visible beneath the white robe.
She was glad she had modified her Shakespeare
to suit her listener, though &#8220;Out,
<i>dreadful</i> spot!&#8221; was not nearly as bloodcurdling
as the original.</p>
<p>Miss Becky, meanwhile, had not paused
in her narration.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a long-winded young man,&#8221;
she was saying, &#8220;him that sarsed his girl,
&#8217;n&#8217; he went slashin&#8217; round, killin&#8217; folks off
in a kind of an aimless way, an&#8217;&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It must have been <i>Hamlet</i> that you
saw!&#8221; cried Nannie, much excited. &#8220;Oh,
I do so want to see <i>Hamlet</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, <i>Hamlet</i>; that was it. And then
there was a ghost in it that sent the
shivers down my back; &#8217;n&#8217; a king &#8217;n&#8217;
queen; &#8217;n&#8217; the king looked for all the
world like Deacon Ember, Jenny Lowe&#8217;s
grandpa, that died before you was born;
&#8217;n&#8217; I declare, I <i>did</i> enjoy it! &#8217;Twas jest
like bein&#8217; alive in history times! Why, I
ain&#8217;t had sech shivers down my spine&#8217;s
the ghost give me, sence that day, till I
seen you standin&#8217; there tryin&#8217; to wash your
hands without any water, &#8217;n&#8217; your eyes
rollin&#8217; fit to scare the cat!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you like to have me do it again
for you, Miss Becky?&#8221; asked Nan, springing
to her feet with renewed ardour. And
straightway she stationed herself at the
end of the little room and began propelling
herself forward with occasional erratic
halts.</p>
<p>The September sunshine came slanting
through the tiny panes of glass at the
window, and touched with impartial grace
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
the youthful figure of distracted mien, the
worsted tidies on the haircloth sofa, and
the neat alpaca occupant of the stuffed
&#8220;rocker.&#8221; Again the sewing was forgotten,
and Miss Becky&#8217;s glittering spectacles
were fixed upon the tragic queen. As
the queer little figure stalked solemnly
down the room, eyes fixed in a glassy
stare, hands wringing one another distressfully;
as a moving wail rent the air,
to the effect that &#8220;all the perfumes of
Arabia will not sweeten this little hand,&#8221;
a most agreeable succession of shivers
made a highway of Miss Becky&#8217;s spine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you ever go to the theatre
now, Miss Becky?&#8221; Nannie asked, when,
having laid aside her tragic toggery, she
came in her own person to take her
leave. &#8220;I should think you&#8217;d like to go
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I should be reel tickled to go
again, but I ain&#8217;t got nobody to go with,
and, well&mdash;there&#8217;s other reasons besides.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nannie blushed to think how inconsiderate
she had been to force her old friend
to allude, even indirectly, to her poverty,
and she walked up the dusty road to her
own gate, filled with compunction. Just
outside the gate was a little wilderness of
goldenrod and asters. She thought what
a pity it was they should get so gray with
dust. Poor things, they could not help
it; they had to stay where chance had
planted them unless somebody picked
them and carried them away, and even then
they left their roots behind them. Somehow
they made her think of Miss Becky,
living her little narrow, stationary life all
alone in the old tumble-down farmhouse.
And just at this point in her reflections
a delightful scheme came into her head.</p>
<p>Now, Nannie was the recipient of a
slender monthly allowance intended for
gloves and ruchings, postage stamps, and
the like, and, having spent the last four
months far from the allurements of city
shops, she happened at this juncture to
be in funds. Her stock of gloves, to be
sure, was pretty well exhausted, and
Christmas was only a few months away.
But Miss Becky was nearer still, and
Nannie had no hesitation between the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
two claims. As a natural consequence it
happened that, one pleasant day early in
October, Miss Becky, in her best black
bonnet, found herself steaming up to Boston,
about to do Nannie &#8220;a real favour&#8221;
by chaperoning her to the theatre. Miss
Becky was so much impressed by the
gravity of her responsibility that she
hardly took in the fact that she was going
to the theatre herself!</p>
<p>They were to see <i>The Shaughraun</i>&mdash;a
play which her best friend had assured
Nannie was &#8220;just great&#8221;; and as the
train rushed up to town the young hostess
was at a loss to decide whether she was
happier on her own account or on Miss
Becky&#8217;s. To be sure, she was just a little
disappointed about Miss Becky, who
seemed curiously silent and stiff; and
when they came out of the station and
walked up the crowded city street, the old
lady held her by the sleeve and looked
bewildered and frightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long is it since you&#8217;ve been in
Boston?&#8221; Nannie asked, looking up into
the anxious old face framed in the black
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
silk bonnet which looked twice as old-fashioned
as ever before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not sence Sophia was married &#8217;n&#8217; we
came up to select her weddin&#8217; gownd. I
was quite a girl then, an&#8217; I guess I felt
more at home in a crowd than I do now.
We don&#8217;t often hev much of a crowd out
our way.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were among the first to take their
seats at the theatre. Mr. Ray had got
places for them only three rows back from
the stage, and, once established there,
Nannie felt that they were in a safe haven,
where her guest could grow calm and
responsive again.</p>
<p>At first Miss Becky was almost too
overawed to speak, but after a while she
got the better of the situation and began
telling Nannie all about Sophia and her
&#8220;true-so,&#8221; and how they got lost on their
way to the station and almost missed their
train, which was the only train &#8220;out&#8221; in
old times.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do hope we sha&#8217;n&#8217;t miss our train
to-night, my dear! It doos seem&#8217;s though
we might &#8217;f they don&#8217;t begin pretty soon,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
and the old lady&mdash;for a very old lady she
seemed to have become all of a sudden&mdash;fidgeted
in her chair, and looked over her
shoulder to see if the seats were not filling
up.</p>
<p>&#8220;We sha&#8217;n&#8217;t lose our train, Miss Becky,&#8221;
Nannie assured her. &#8220;You know it doesn&#8217;t
go until half-past five o&#8217;clock, and the
play is always over before five. And even
if we did miss it we could take the seven-fifteen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear, no! I sh&#8217;d feel reel bad to
miss the train. Why, it gits dark by six
o&#8217;clock, &#8217;n&#8217; &#8217;twouldn&#8217;t be safe for us to
be goin&#8217; round the city streets after dark.
We might git garroted or, or&mdash;<i>spoken to!</i>
Dear me! I <i>wish</i> they would begin!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it gets late, Miss Becky, we won&#8217;t
wait for the end of the play,&#8221; said Nannie,
while a very distinct pang seized her at
thought of missing anything.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that <i>would</i> be better!&#8221; Miss
Becky cried, with evident relief. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you think it might be better to go out a
little early, anyway? They&#8217;ll be such a
crowd when everybody tries to go out to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
once that we might git delayed. <i>My!</i>
what a sight of people there is already!
And up in the galleries, too! Ain&#8217;t you
&#8217;most afeared to stay in sech a crowd?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, Miss Becky. It&#8217;s just like
this always, and nothing ever happens.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Them galleries don&#8217;t look strong
enough to hold many people. Why, Nannie,
see! They ain&#8217;t any <i>pillows</i> under
&#8217;em! What do you suppose keeps &#8217;em up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m sure; but they&#8217;re
safe enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this point the orchestra struck up a
popular tune and silence fell upon Miss
Becky. She sat, stiff and severe, gazing
straight before her, and when Nannie ventured
to make a remark she received only
a reproving look in reply.</p>
<p>How strange it was, Nannie thought!
She had meant to give Miss Becky such
a treat, and here sat her guest, looking
anxious and distressed&mdash;yes, more anxious
and distressed than she looked a year ago
when her cow died. But then the play
had not begun yet, Nannie reflected,
with a gleam of hope. When the play
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
had once begun, Miss Becky would forget
all her worries and be as &#8220;tickled&#8221; as she
had counted on her being. And when
once the curtain had gone up, Nannie at
least had no more misgivings. Her fancy
was instantly taken captive, first by the
charming young officer and his pretty
Irish sweetheart, then by the fine old
priest, then by Con himself,&mdash;dear, droll,
happy-go-lucky Con, with his picturesque
foibles, his bubbling humour, and his phenomenal
virtues. From the moment of
his entry, with &#8220;Tatters&#8221; just not at his
heels, Nannie was all smiles and tears.</p>
<p>Miss Becky, meanwhile, sat erect as a
ramrod, a look of perplexity screwing her
wrinkles all out of shape. Her bonnet
had got somewhat askew from her constant
effort to keep an eye on those unsupported
galleries, and there was a general
air of discomfort about her, which was the
first thing that struck Nannie when, as the
curtain fell upon the first act, she turned
to look at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you enjoying it, Miss Becky?&#8221;
she asked, with quick anxiety.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I&#8217;m hevin&#8217; a reel pleasant
time. &#8217;T ain&#8217;t through yet, is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, no; it&#8217;s only just begun.
There&#8217;s lots more! May Colby says
that Con gets them all out of all their
troubles and almost gets killed himself!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I sh&#8217;d think &#8217;t would take a long time.
Are you sure &#8217;t ain&#8217;t most five o&#8217;clock?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no; it&#8217;s only three. See! And
my watch is fast, too. Wasn&#8217;t it funny
about the letter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I didn&#8217;t quite understand about
that. What made &#8217;em laugh so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, that was because he couldn&#8217;t
read, and so he had to make it all up out
of his head.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; declared Miss Becky, with
strong disapproval, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;d
ought to hev deceived his mother that
way; do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>This was a poser; but at that moment
the orchestra came to the rescue with a
new tune, and Nannie was spared the
necessity of replying.</p>
<p>After that the play became every moment
more exciting and the central figure
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
more entirely captivating, and even between
the acts Nannie was preoccupied
and unobservant. They had got to the
prison scene, with all its ingenious intricacies
of plot and stage machinery; Con
had accomplished the rescue, and was
scrambling over the rocks, when suddenly
the sharp report of a rifle rang out, followed
by another, and then another, in
quick succession.</p>
<p>Instantly Nannie felt her arm clutched,
and she heard Miss Becky saying: &#8220;You
must come right away, this very minute!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, please not, Miss Becky,&#8221; she implored.</p>
<p>But there was a resolute gleam in Miss
Becky&#8217;s eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come right along, child,&#8221; she whispered,
hoarsely, &#8220;come right along with
me!&#8221;&mdash;and poor Nannie, to her consternation
and chagrin, found herself absolutely
obliged to follow.</p>
<p>The whole row of people stood up to
let them pass, and every kind of look&mdash;glances
of amusement and curiosity, of
annoyance and of sympathy&mdash;followed the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
oddly assorted pair, as they made their
way out of the slip and then up the aisle.</p>
<p>Once outside the door, the tension of
Miss Becky&#8217;s face relaxed, but she did not
waver in her determination.</p>
<p>&#8220;There, child!&#8221; she cried, as they
walked down the slight incline of the long
passageway to the street. &#8220;There! I
am glad I had strength given me to do
my duty by you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Miss Becky, there wasn&#8217;t a bit
of danger,&#8221; Nannie protested, bravely
keeping the tears back in her cruel disappointment.
&#8220;Really, there wasn&#8217;t.
Won&#8217;t you <i>please</i> go back with me, and
just stand inside the door and see the end
of it? I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;d let us stand inside
the door.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nannie Ray,&#8221; Miss Becky replied,
looking very fiercely at the girl&#8217;s flushed
cheeks and imploring eyes, &#8220;if you knew
as much about firearms as I do, you
wouldn&#8217;t ask such a thing. But there!
It&#8217;s jest because you&#8217;re young and inexperienced
that your ma wanted me to
come and look after you. I guess she&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
be thankful she was so foresighted when
she hears of the danger you was in.&#8221;</p>
<p>In her exultation and relief of mind,
Miss Becky marched on, regardless of
jostling crowds and thronging teams. Her
whole attitude had changed. She was no
longer the timid, shrinking old woman;
she was the responsible guardian, aware
of the importance of her charge, and nothing
was ever to convince her that she
had not as good as saved Nannie&#8217;s life on
that occasion.</p>
<p>Then Nannie, as became a hostess, accepted
the situation with the best grace in
the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you what let&#8217;s do, Miss Becky,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go and get some ice-cream.
That is, if you like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The stern old face relaxed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; I like ice-cream, especially
vanilla. But&mdash;do you think we&#8217;ve got
time enough?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got an hour and a quarter
before the train goes. Let&#8217;s come in
here and get it.&#8221;</p>
<p>From the crowded street they passed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
in at the doorway and walked between
marble counters to what seemed to Miss
Becky a scene in fairyland. Ascending
two or three broad steps, on each side of
which an antlered stag kept guard, they
stepped upon a great carpeted space,
lighted from above,&mdash;a space in the middle
of which was a fountain, springing
high into the air, and splashing back into
a round basin lined with shining shells and
pebbles, over and among which goldfish
swam and dove like animated jewels.
Ferns and palms grew all about the basin,
and in among the greenery was a little
table where Nannie and her guest sat
hidden safe away from the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this doos beat all!&#8221; the old lady
exclaimed, gazing at the fountain with an
expression of rapt delight&mdash;just the expression
that Nannie had counted upon
seeing among the wrinkles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you like it?&#8221; she asked, all her
disappointment and chagrin forgotten.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like it? Why, it&#8217;s the most tasty
place I was ever in! It&#8217;s better than any
play; it&#8217;s like bein&#8217; in a play yourself!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
Jest see them pillows supportin&#8217; that
gallery! &#8217;N&#8217; them picters of tropical
fruits! &#8217;N&#8217; this ice-cream! Why, it&#8217;s
different from what we hev at the Sunday-school
picnics! &#8217;Pears to me it&#8217;s
more creamy!&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, at last, Miss Becky had lost all
thought of the passage of time. She took
her ice-cream, just a little at a time, off
the tip-end of her spoon, and with every
mouthful the look of content grew deeper.
One of the little cakes that were served
with the ice-cream was a macaroon with a
sugar swan upon it&mdash;&#8220;a reel little statoo
of a swan,&#8221; Miss Becky called it. She
could not be persuaded to eat it, but she
studied it with such undisguised admiration
that Nannie ventured to suggest that
she take it home with her. Again Miss
Becky was enchanted. She wrapped it
in her pocket-handkerchief, and placed it
carefully in her reticule, whence it was to
emerge only to enter upon a long and
admired career as a parlour ornament.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now, Miss Becky,&#8221; Nannie queried,
as they sat there embowered in palms
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
and ferns, listening to the plash of the
fountain, &#8220;didn&#8217;t you enjoy the play at
all?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said Miss Becky, &#8220;I had a
very pleasant time before they got so
reckless with their guns. But&mdash;I wonder
whether they take sech pains with the the-etter&#8217;s
they used to? Why, when I went
with Uncle &#8217;Bijah Lane that time, they all
wore the most beautiful clothes. Even the
men was dressed out in velvets and satins,
and they wa&#8217;n&#8217;t anybody on the stage that
didn&#8217;t make a good appearance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, you know, this was a different
sort of play, Miss Becky. The folks
in <i>The Shaughraun</i> weren&#8217;t kings and
queens, but just every-day people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, s&#8217;posin&#8217; they was! I don&#8217;t see
no excuse for that man Con goin&#8217; round
lookin&#8217; so slack. I sh&#8217;d think he might at
least git a whole coat to wear when he
&#8217;pears before the public!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;re sorry you came,&#8221;
said Nannie, very meekly, feeling quite
ashamed of her poor little party.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, I ain&#8217;t! Why, child, I&#8217;d hev
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
come <i>barefoot</i> to see this place here, with
the founting a-splashin&#8217; and the fishes a-gleamin&#8217;!
<i>Barefoot</i>, I tell ye!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a forcible expression, yet Nannie
was not quite reassured. She still demurred.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the play was the principal thing,
you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The play? Well, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said
Miss Becky, thoughtfully. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8217;s
I&#8217;m so terrible sot on the the<i>ett</i>er&#8217;s I
thought for. I&#8217;d a good deal ruther hev
you come over &#8217;n do that sleep-walkin&#8217;
piece for me. I don&#8217;t want nothin&#8217; better&#8217;n
that. &#8217;F I can see you act that once
in a while, &#8217;n&#8217; hev this here Garding of
Eden to think about,&mdash;a founting playin&#8217;
right in the house, &#8217;n&#8217; all,&mdash;I ain&#8217;t likely to
want for amusement.&#8221;</p>
<p>The best bonnet was still very much
askew, but the pleasant old face within,
whose wrinkles had resumed their accustomed
grooves, was irradiated with a look
of unmistakable beatitude; and somehow
it was borne in upon Nannie that her theatre
party had been a success after all.</p>

</div>
<p class='tp' style='font-size:1.2em;margin-bottom:20px;'>CHAPTER I</p>
<p class='tp' style='font-size:1em;margin-bottom:30px;'>OLIVIA&#8217;S SUN-DIAL</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all we need to make it the prettiest
garden in Dunbridge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm! And why must we have the
prettiest garden in Dunbridge?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>
<p>Here was a deadlock&mdash;a thing quite
shockingly out of place in a garden, and
one&#8217;s own particular garden at that!</p>
<p>Olivia Page could make almost anything
grow, as she had abundantly proved,
but even her garden-craft could hardly
suffice for the setting of a sun-dial on a
pedestal of snow-white marble over there
where the four triangular rose-beds converged
to a circle, and where the south
sun would play on it all day long.</p>
<p>For a year Olivia had dreamed of this,
and, since she was not a churlishly reticent
young person, it was not the first intimation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
her father had received of her desire.
Not until to-day, however, had she asked
outright for what she wanted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you would say something
more,&#8221; she remarked, glancing sidewise at
the professor&#8217;s deeply corrugated countenance,
which, for all their intimacy, was
sometimes difficult to decipher. She had
heard of girls who could twist their
parents round their fingers; she wondered
how they did it.</p>
<p>The two were sitting on the white half-circle
of a bench that stood at the west
boundary of the old tennis-court, just
where one end of the net used to be
staked up. Excepting for that break,
three sides of the garden were fenced in
by the high wire screen originally designed
to keep the tennis balls within
bounds, and now doing duty as a trellis
over which a luxuriant woodbine clambered,
waving its reddening tendrils in
the light September breeze. Wide flowerbeds
bordered the entire court, the central
turf being broken only by the cluster
of rose-beds at the further end. From the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
white bench one looked across the grass
to a broad flight of veranda steps, flanked
on the right by a mass of white boltonia,
while on the left a superb growth of
New England asters reared their sturdy
heads.</p>
<p>The garden had been a great success
this year, quite the admiration of the
neighbourhood. Really, Papa must be
proud of it, and it was all Olivia&#8217;s doing.
Who would ever guess that it had had its
modest beginnings in half a dozen tin
cracker-boxes with holes bored in the bottoms,
where, in March, two years ago,
she had planted queer little brown seeds
as hard as pebbles, which Nature had
straightway taken in hand, softening and
expanding them down there in the dark,
till they came alive, and began feeling
their way up to meet the sun. Ah, the
bliss of seeing those first tiny shoots turn
into stems and leaflets, ready to play their
part in the great spring awakening!
Would Olivia ever love any flowers quite
as she had loved those first seedlings,
especially a certain pentstemon, which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
blossomed &#8220;white with purple spots,&#8221; exactly
as the seed-catalogue had promised?</p>
<p>Yes, the garden was a great success,
and just now it was at one of its prettiest
moments, gay with autumn colours; the
rudbeckia in its glory, and the great pink
blossoms of the hibiscus spreading their
skirts for all the world like ladies in an
old-time minuet, while over yonder the
soldier spikes of the flame-flower threatened
to set the woodbine afire. Olivia
loved the Latin names, but somehow
&#8220;tritonia&#8221; did not seem to express those
spikes of burning colour. And the roses!
How lovely those late hybrids were!
Why, the way that Margaret Dickson
drooped her head above the pansies, still
blooming freely at her feet, was enough
to melt the heart of a Salem gibraltar!
A pity that the professor&#8217;s attention
seemed for the moment to be riveted
upon the toe of his boot!</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you would say something
more,&#8221; Olivia repeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something different, you mean,&#8221; and
Doctor Page smiled, benignly and stubbornly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></p>
<p>&#8220;For instance, you might tell me why
you are opposed to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I might; you said, only the other
day, that I sometimes displayed almost
human intelligence!&#8221;</p>
<p>The professor liked to have his jokes
remembered; but still he seemed inclined
to temporise.</p>
<p>&#8220;I might say that we couldn&#8217;t afford it.
It is generally conceded that Alma Mater
is not a munificent provider.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; and you might say that my great-grandfather
was not an East India trader&mdash;only
you don&#8217;t tell fibs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or that a sun-dial is an anachronism.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are too good a Latin scholar for
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So a subterfuge won&#8217;t do? Very
well; then you&#8217;ll have to put up with a
psychological proposition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How interesting!&#8221;</p>
<p>The professor glanced at the expectant
young face turned toward him, and he
could not but admit that his estimate of
its owner&#8217;s intelligence had been well
within the truth.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You think a sun-dial would make it
the prettiest garden in Dunbridge?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure it would.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that is what you are aiming at?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, I have noticed that when you
have got what you are aiming at you lose
interest in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O Papa!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There was tennis,&#8221; he went on, marking
off the list on a combative forefinger,
&#8220;and cookery; there was the Polyglot
Club, and the Sketching Club, and&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Papa! They were every one of
them good things, and I got a lot out of
them; truly, I did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt; but as soon as you could
play tennis, or sketch a pine tree, or toss
an omelette a little better than the other
girls, you had squeezed your orange dry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Papa! I&#8217;ve stuck to gardening
for more than two years!&#8221; Olivia&#8217;s
tone seemed to give those years the dignity
of centuries.</p>
<p>&#8220;True; but you haven&#8217;t got your sun-dial.
You will consider that the finishing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
touch, and then before we know it
you will be wanting to turn the whole
thing into a sand-garden for the little
micks at the Corners.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not such a bad idea,&#8221; Olivia admitted
unguardedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;There you are! The mere mention
of a new scheme is enough to set you
agog!&#8221;</p>
<p>But this was not their first fencing
match, and Olivia had learned to parry.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you believed in people being
open-minded,&#8221; she ventured demurely.</p>
<p>&#8220;And so I do; but not so open-minded
that for every new idea that comes in an
old one goes out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the sun-dial hasn&#8217;t got away yet,&#8221;
she laughed, springing to her feet and
going over to the court-end of the garden,
where she placed herself in the exact centre
of the converging rose-beds.</p>
<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; she cried; &#8220;don&#8217;t you see
how my white gown lights up the whole
place? It&#8217;s just the high light that it
needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so it was: a fact of which no one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
was better aware than the professor. As
he, too, rose and sauntered toward the
house he could not deny that Olivia&#8217;s
ideas were usually good. The only trouble
was that she had too many of them;
and here was the kernel of truth that
gave substance to his whimsical argument.
The beauty of the garden was not
lost upon him, nor yet the skill and industry
of the young gardener. But more
important than either was the advantage
to the girl&#8217;s health. Olivia was sound as
a nut; of course she was! There could
be no doubt of that. But&mdash;so had her
mother seemed, until that fatal winter ten
years ago. He did not fear for Olivia;
why should he? Only&mdash;well, this out-of-door
life was a capital thing for anybody.
No, he could not have her tire of her
garden.</p>
<p>At the foot of the veranda steps Dr.
Page paused and glanced again at his
daughter. She had left the rose-beds and
was already intent upon her work, pulling
seeds from the hollyhocks over yonder.
She made a pretty picture in her white
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
gown, standing shoulder-high among the
brown stalks, her slender fingers deftly
gleaning from such as showed no rust.
The child was really very persistent about
her gardening; she had fairly earned an
indulgence. Perhaps, after all, she might
be trusted. He moved a few steps toward
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Olivia,&#8221; he said,&mdash;and the first word
betrayed his relenting,&mdash;&#8220;Olivia, your
sun-dial scheme is not such a bad idea.
I should rather like that white-petticoat
effect myself. Supposing we say that if
between now and next June you don&#8217;t
think of anything you want more, we&#8217;ll
have it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you bless&egrave;d angel! What could
I want more?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Time will show,&#8221; the bless&egrave;d angel replied,
retracing his steps toward the house&mdash;unaided
by angelic wings!</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Olivia called confidently. &#8220;It&#8217;s
the sun-dial that time will show, and afterward&mdash;why,
the sun-dial will show
the time!&#8221;&mdash;and although he made no
sign, she knew there were little puckers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
of amused approval about her father&#8217;s
mouth.</p>
<p>As if she could ever want anything
more than a sun-dial! she thought, while
she passed along the borders, harvesting
her little crop. She had finished with the
hollyhocks, and now she was bending over
a bed of withered columbines. And there
were the foxglove seeds still clinging.
Really, it was almost impossible to keep
up. How brilliant the salvia was to-day,
and what a brave second blossoming that
was of the delphinium, its knightly spurs,
metallic blue, gleaming in the sun!</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she declared to herself, &#8220;there
will never be anything so much worth
while as the garden. Why, of course
there won&#8217;t; because Nature is the best
thing in the world&mdash;the very best.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Plase, ma&#8217;am, will ye gimme a
bowkay?&#8221;</p>
<p>Olivia turned, startled by a voice so near
at hand, for she had heard no footfall on
the thick turf. There, in the centre of
the grass-grown space, stood two comical
little midgets, their smutty yet cherubic
faces blooming brightly above garments
highly coloured and earthy, too, as the
autumn garden-beds.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

&#8220;Please ma&#8217;am, will ye gimme a bowkay?&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Dear me!&#8221; Olivia laughed, &#8220;how
things do sprout in a garden! Did you
come right up out of the ground?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Plase, ma&#8217;am, a bowkay! Me mudder&#8217;s
sick an&#8217; me fader&#8217;s goned away.&#8221;</p>
<p>The speaker, a boy of five, stood holding
by the hand something in the way of
a sister, about two sizes smaller. At
Olivia&#8217;s little joke, which they did not
in the least understand, they had both
grinned sympathetically, showing rows of
diminutive teeth as white and even as
snow-berries.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless your little hearts, of course you
shall have a bouquet! Come and choose
one,&#8221;&mdash;and taking a hand of each Olivia
led them slowly along the brilliant borders.</p>
<p>They were a bit shy at first, but they
soon picked up their courage, and Patsy
fell to accumulating a mass of incongruous
blossoms whose colours fought each
other tooth and nail. Little Biddy, more
modest, as beseemed her inferior rank in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
the scale of being, fixed her heart upon a
single flame-flower which absolutely refused
to reconcile itself with the ingenuous
pink of her calico frock.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long has your mother been ill?&#8221;
Olivia asked of the boy, who by this time
was quite hidden behind a perfect forest
of asters and larkspur and lobelia cardinalis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me mudder&#8217;s always sick. She
coughs an&#8217; coughs, and den she lays
on de bed long whiles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And she likes flowers?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am; me an&#8217; Biddy picked a
bowkay outen a ashba&#8217;l oncet, an&#8217; me mudder
sticked it in a tumbler an&#8217; loved it.
Come, Biddy, make de lady a bow!&#8221;
Upon which the small Chesterfield stood
off a few steps and gave an absurd little
bob of a bow which Biddy gravely endeavoured
to imitate.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll go with you,&#8221; said Olivia,
open-minded as ever to a new interest;
and hand in hand and chattering amicably,
the three moved across the turf and down
the long gravel walk to the dusty street.
Surprising how short the distance was between
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
the sweet seclusion of the old tennis-court
and the squalid quarter where these
little human blossoms grew!</p>
<p>Olivia was thinking of that as she stood
on the veranda an hour later, looking
down upon the flowery kingdom to which
all her interest and ambition had been
pledged. Yes, it was lovely, lovely in the
long afternoon light, and it would have
been lovelier still with the gleaming marble
she had dreamed of. She really tried to
keep her mind upon it, to forget the little
drama over there in the stuffy tenement.
But no; she was too good a gardener for
that. Was not a whole family broken and
wilting for lack of means to transplant it?</p>
<p>The doctor had ordered Mrs. O&#8217;Trannon
to Colorado, and Mike had dropped his
work as &#8220;finisher&#8221;&mdash;whatever that might
be&mdash;and had gone out to prepare the way
for the others to follow. He had found
no chance to work at his trade, but he
had got a job on a ranch, where the pay
was small, but the living good. A fine
place it would be for the invalid and the
children, when once he could get together
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
the money to send for them. But meanwhile
here they were, and the winter coming
on.</p>
<p>As Olivia stood looking down upon her
beloved garden, she could not seem to
see anything but brown stalks and dead
blossoms. All that lavish colour looked
fictitious and transitory; she had somehow
lost faith in it.</p>
<p>Mrs. O&#8217;Trannon had been pleased with
the flowers; she had grown up on a farm,
she said. Sure she never&#8217;d ha&#8217; got sick at
all if she&#8217;d ha&#8217; stayed where she belonged.
But then, where would Mike have been,
and the babies? And where would Mike
be, and the babies, Olivia thought with a
pang,&mdash;where would they be if the mother
wilted and died? She turned, suddenly,
and passed in at the glass doors and on to
her father&#8217;s study.</p>
<p>At sight of the kind, quizzical face
lifted at her entrance, Olivia winced a bit.
About an hour and a half it must be, since
he said it, and he had given her a year!
As if that made any difference! she told
herself, with a little defiant movement of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
the chin, as she crossed the room and
seated herself at the opposite side of the
big writing-table where she could face the
music handsomely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Olivia; changed your mind
yet?&#8221; the professor inquired, struck, perhaps,
by the resolution of her aspect.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered, in an impressive
tone, &#8220;I&#8217;ve thought of something I should
prefer to a sun-dial.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Page took off his glasses and laid
them upon his open book. He did not
really imagine that she was serious&mdash;such
a turn-about-face was too precipitate even
for Olivia; but it pleased him to meet
her on her own ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what is it this time? A sixty-inch
telescope? Or a diamond tiara?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, no. Those are things I had
not thought of&mdash;before! It&#8217;s a kind of
gardening project&mdash;a little matter of transplanting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will it cost a hundred and fifty
dollars?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About that, I should think, to do it
properly and comfortably. And&mdash;it can&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
wait till June. It&#8217;s the kind of transplanting
that has to be done in the autumn.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, dropping the little fiction, and
resting her chin upon her folded hands,
the better to transfix her father&#8217;s mocking
countenance,&mdash;&#8220;Papa,&#8221; she said, &#8220;there&#8217;s
a poor family down at the Corners,&mdash;our
neighbours, you know,&mdash;and the mother
is dying for want of transplanting, just
like the beautiful hydrangea&mdash;you remember?&mdash;that
I didn&#8217;t understand about till it
was too late. I never knew what too late
meant, till I saw that splendid great bush
lying stone-dead on the ground when we
came home from the Adirondacks last
year. A great healthy hydrangea dying
just for lack of the right kind of soil!
And now, here is this good human woman,
that might live out her life and bring up
her little family, and be happy and useful
for years to come. Such a nice woman
she must be to name her babies Patsy and
Biddy, when she might have called them
Algernon and Celestina, you know, and
just spoiled it all!&mdash;and such a nice, kind
husband to take care of her on a big ranch
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
where there&#8217;s good air, and lots to eat, and
plenty of work and not too much, and&mdash;why
Papa! they might have a garden out
there! who knows? What a thing that
would be for the prairie! A real New
England garden!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With a sun-dial?&#8221; the professor interposed.</p>
<p>For an instant Olivia&#8217;s face fell, but
only for an instant.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking,&#8221; she said, with a
very convincing seriousness, &#8220;that perhaps
a sun-dial is not so important, after
all. At any rate it&#8217;s not so important as
the mother of a family; now, is it, Papa?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That depends upon the point of
view,&#8221; the professor opined. &#8220;As a high
light among the rose-bushes I should
be constrained to give my vote for the
sun-dial.&#8221;</p>
<p>Olivia sprang to her feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;That means that you are coming
straight over with me to see Mrs. O&#8217;Trannon,&#8221;
she cried, &#8220;and that you are going
to have the whole family packed off to
Colorado quicker&#8217;n a wink! Come along,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
please! There&#8217;s plenty of time before
dinner!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just another of Nature&#8217;s miracles!&#8221;
Olivia observed, as she and her
father stood one morning in late October
watching the workmen pack the sods
about the beautiful pedestal, now securely
planted upon its base of cement and
broken stone. &#8220;It always makes me
think of the wonderful things that came
up in those tin cracker-boxes you used to
make such fun of. There really doesn&#8217;t
seem to be any place too unlikely for
Nature to set things going in.&#8221;</p>
<p>The marble was but roughly hewn, in
lines that held the suggestion of an hourglass.
The top only was smoothly finished,
while here and there on the curving
sides the hint of a leaf, a blossom, a trailing
vine, came and went with the point of
view, like cloud-pictures or the pencillings
of Jack Frost. It was as if a &#8217;prentice-hand
had tried to express the soul of an artist,
too self-distrustful to work more boldly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Funny, how things come into your
head,&#8221; Olivia went on. &#8220;Do you know,
Papa, that day when I was helping Mrs.
O&#8217;Trannon with her preposterous packing
and suddenly came upon this miracle hidden
away under an old bedquilt, the only
thing I could think of was the way my
first pentstemons came out, &#8216;white with
purple spots,&#8217; exactly as I had chosen
them by the seed-catalogue. And to
think that she had bought it for a dollar
of that poor stone-cutter&#8217;s widow that was
moving out&mdash;bought it to make pastry on
because the top was smooth and cold!
And then had never had time to make but
one pie in the three years! I wish you
could have heard her tell about it. &#8216;Faith,
it cost me a dollar, me one pie did, an&#8217;
Mike says it&#8217;s lucky it was that I didn&#8217;t
make a dozen whin they come so high!
Silly b&#8217;y, that Mike!&#8217; O Papa, isn&#8217;t it
heavenly that they&#8217;re together again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So you think there is nothing Nature
can&#8217;t do?&#8221; Dr. Page mused, with apparent
irrelevance. &#8220;How about the sun-dial
itself?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Nature will attend to that, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She will, will she? And in what particular
tin cracker-box should you look for
it to come up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be polite to say,&#8221; Olivia
declared, looking with unmistakable significance
straight into her father&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Saucebox!&#8221; he chuckled.</p>
<p>And when, in early June, the brass disk
of the sun-dial had begun its record of
happy hours, and still Olivia toiled with
unabated zeal at her garden, the rose of
health blooming ever brighter in her face,
a great sense of satisfaction and approval
took possession of her father&#8217;s mind. But
he only remarked, in a casual manner, as
they sat together on the white bench one
fragrant sunset hour:</p>
<p>&#8220;After all, I&#8217;m not sure but Nature&#8217;s
biggest miracle has been performed in the
saucebox.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Olivia, smiling softly, answered:
&#8220;I told you, you know, that there isn&#8217;t
any place too unlikely for Nature to set
things going in!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll warrant that &#8217;he, she, or it&#8217; will
come! Di usually bags her game!&#8221;</p>
<p>The speaker, Mr. Thomas Crosby,
must have had implicit faith in his
daughter&#8217;s prowess to venture such a
confident assertion as that, for he was
quite in the dark as to who &#8220;he, she, or
it&#8221; might be.</p>
<p>It was a cozy November evening, when
open fires and friendly drop-lights are in
order, and the three grown-folks of the
family were enjoying these luxuries. Mr.
Crosby was supposed to be reading his
paper, but he had a sociable way of letting
fall an occasional item of interest, or of
letting fall the paper itself, at the first
hint of interest in the remarks of his wife
and daughter.</p>
<p>Only within a very short time had
there been three grown-folks in the family,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
unless, indeed, we count Rollo, the Gordon
setter, who had attained his majority
years ago. Di, who was but just turned
sixteen, really did not like to remember
how very recently she had been sent to
bed at eight o&#8217;clock!</p>
<p>Could Mr. Crosby have guessed the
scheme which was occupying the active
brain of the young person engaged in
embroidering harmless bachelor&#8217;s buttons
upon a linen centrepiece, he would have
been very much astonished,&mdash;whether
pleasurably or otherwise, events alone
must show. And since events had been
taken in hand by Di the revelation was
not likely to be long delayed.</p>
<p>The incident which had elicited her
father&#8217;s declaration of confidence was a
request on Di&#8217;s part to be allowed the
privilege of inviting a guest of her own
choosing to the Thanksgiving dinner.
The family party was to be materially
reduced this year, for Mrs. Crosby&#8217;s
mother and sister, their only available
relatives, were at that moment sojourning
in Rome, where, if they were sufficiently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
mindful of current maxims to do as the
Romans do, they were very unlikely to
meet with any satisfactory combination of
turkey and plum-pudding. It was with
that fact in view, that Di felt a fair
degree of assurance in preferring her
request. They all liked each other, of
course, better than they liked anybody
else, but, really, one must do something a
little out of the common on Thanksgiving
day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; Di&#8217;s mother had agreed;
&#8220;you shall invite any one you choose. I
have been wishing we could think of some
one to ask, but people all have their own
family parties on Thanksgiving day. Is
it to be one of your girl friends?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is my secret,&#8221; Di had replied,
sedately; &#8220;but, whoever it is, he, she,
or it is a very important personage, and
will have to be treated with great consideration!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And how is that very <i>un</i>important
personage, Di Crosby, going to get hold
of so great a dignitary?&#8221; Mrs. Crosby
had laughingly inquired. At which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
juncture Mr. Crosby had expressed his belief
that Di would bag her game.</p>
<p>That the prospective dinner should be
incomplete was all the harder, considering
the fact that the Crosbys were, by good
rights, the possessors of that most desired
ornament of such an occasion,&mdash;a <i>bona
fide</i> grandfather. Not only was old Mr.
Crosby living, and in excellent health,
but his residence was not above a dozen
blocks removed from his son&#8217;s house.
And yet no grandfather had ever graced
their Thanksgiving feast.</p>
<p>Family quarrels are an unpleasant subject
at the best, and since Di herself had
never learned the precise cause of the
long estrangement between father and
son, in which the old gentleman had
decreed that his son&#8217;s wife and children
should share, it is hardly worth while to
recount it here. Suffice it to say, that it
was a very old quarrel indeed, older than
Di herself, and one to which Mr. and
Mrs. Crosby never alluded.</p>
<p>It was six years ago, when Di, the eldest
of the children, was ten years of age, that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
she had come home from school one day,
breathless with excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mamma!&#8221; she cried, bursting into the
room where her mother was changing the
baby&#8217;s frock: &#8220;Mamma! Have I got a
grandfather?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Crosby glanced furtively at the
round eyes of the baby, and took the precaution
of smothering him in billows of
white lawn before replying, rather softly:
&#8220;Yes, dear; Papa&#8217;s father is living. Why
do you ask?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw him to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You saw him? Where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On the street.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you know it was he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sallie Watson asked me why I didn&#8217;t
bow to my grandfather.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what did you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I said: &#8216;Never you mind!&#8217; And then
I ran home all the way, as tight as ever I
could run! Mamma, why don&#8217;t we ever
see him?&#8221;</p>
<p>The baby&#8217;s head was just emerging from
temporary eclipse, and Mrs. Crosby&#8217;s
voice dropped still lower, as she answered:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Because, dear, <i>he doesn&#8217;t wish it</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was something so gently conclusive
in this answer that little Di was
silenced. Yet the look in her mother&#8217;s
face had not escaped her; a wistful, hurt
look, such as the child had never seen
there before. And in her own mind Di
asked many questions.</p>
<p>What did it all mean? How did it
happen that her grandfather did not wish
it? Why was he so different from other
girls&#8217; grandfathers? There must be something
very wrong somewhere, but where
was it? Since it could not possibly be
with her father or mother, it must
be that her grandfather was himself at
fault.</p>
<p>The object of Di&#8217;s perplexities, Mr.
Horatio Crosby, lived all alone in a very
good house, and was in the habit of driving
about in a very pretty victoria; people
bowed to him, people who were friends of
Di&#8217;s father and mother, and must therefore
be creditable acquaintances. All this
she soon discovered, for, having once
come to know her grandfather by sight,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
she seemed to be constantly crossing his
path.</p>
<p>Little by little, as she grew older, Di
picked up certain stray bits of information,
but she never tried to piece them together.
She felt that she would a little rather
not know any more. A quarrel there had
certainly been, some time in the dark
ages before she was born, and the old
man had proved himself obstinate and
implacable. Friendly overtures had been
made from time to time, but he had set his
face against all such advances, and now, for
many, many years,&mdash;as many as three or
four, little Di had gathered,&mdash;the friendly
overtures had ceased.</p>
<p>One gets used to things, and Di got
used to having a grandfather who did not
know her by sight. She was sure he did
not know her, because once, when she was
twelve years old, he had stopped her on
the street to tell her that she had dropped
her pocket-handkerchief. It had been
very polite of the old gentleman, and she
had been glad not to lose her handkerchief.
Yet, as she thanked him, she gave
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
him one searching look, and she told herself
that he had a very cross expression,
as well as a very harsh voice.</p>
<p>This uncomplimentary verdict was
largely due to the fact that, at this period,
Di had quite made up her mind that her
grandfather was a hateful, unreasonable
old despot, and that it served him right
never to come to the family parties, nor to
have any Christmas presents, nor to have
seen the baby, which Mamma said was the
prettiest of all her babies, and which Di
considered the most enchanting object on
the face of the earth.</p>
<p>But again many years had passed,&mdash;four,
in this instance,&mdash;and there came a
time, only a few weeks previous to the
opening of our story, when Di found herself
constrained to modify her view of her
grandfather.</p>
<p>It happened that she had gone with her
drawing teacher, Miss Downs, to an exhibition
of paintings. Among the pictures
was a very striking one entitled <i>Le
Grandp&egrave;re</i>. It represented an old French
peasant, just stopping off work for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
day, with a flock of grandchildren clinging
about his knees. Miss Downs called
Di&#8217;s attention to the wonderful reach of
upland meadow, and the exquisite effect
of the sunset light on the face of the old
man; but, to Di, the meadow and the sunset
light were unimportant accessories to the
central idea. It was the grandfather himself
that commanded all her attention,&mdash;the
look of blissful indulgence on the old
man&#8217;s face; his attitude of protecting affection
towards one young girl in particular,
on whose head the toil-stained hand
rested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, after several minutes
of rapt contemplation: &#8220;Yes; the sunset
is very nice, and the fields; but, oh,
the old man is such a darling!&#8221;</p>
<p>As she spoke she turned to see how her
teacher took her remark, and found herself
face to face, not with Miss Downs, but
with her own grandfather! She gave a
little gasp of surprise, which he appeared
not to notice.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you think him a darling, do you?&#8221;
he asked, and somehow his voice did not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
sound quite as harsh as it had done four
years ago.</p>
<p>Miss Downs had passed on, and there
was no one standing near them, no one
at all in the gallery who shared Di&#8217;s
knowledge of the strange situation. She
felt sure that the old man had no suspicion
of her identity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I do,&#8221; she answered boldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes a darling of him?&#8221; the
old gentleman inquired.</p>
<p>Di felt that this was her opportunity,
and that she was letting it slip. But she
could not help herself, and she only answered
rather lamely:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing, except that he is <i>such
a good grandfather!</i>&#8221; Upon which she
beat a hasty retreat, and fled to the protection
of Miss Downs, whom she found
in an adjoining room.</p>
<p>It was perhaps twenty minutes later
that Di and her teacher passed the picture
again, and, behold, there was the old
gentleman standing, lost in thought, exactly
on the spot where she had left him.
He did not seem to be looking at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
picture, but Di felt certain that he was
thinking of it. And, suddenly, it passed
through her mind like a flash that he was
sorry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; he&#8217;s sorry,&#8221; she said to herself.
&#8220;He&#8217;s sorry, and he doesn&#8217;t know how to
say so!&#8221;</p>
<p>The more she thought of it in the days
that followed,&mdash;and she seemed to be
thinking pretty much all the time of the
old man and the look on his face as he
stood before the picture,&mdash;the more convinced
she became that he was sorry and
did not know how to say so.</p>
<p>&#8220;And he ought not to have to say so,&#8221;
she told herself. &#8220;He&#8217;s an old, old man,
and he ought not to have to say that he is
sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old, old man&mdash;aged sixty-five&mdash;might
have taken exception to that part of
her proposition touching his extreme antiquity,
but we may be pretty sure that he
would have cordially endorsed her opinion
that the dignity of his years forbade his
saying that he was sorry.</p>
<p>In those days Di used to walk often
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
past her grandfather&#8217;s house. It was a
very big house for a single occupant.
Even the stout footman, whom she had
once seen at the door, did not seem stout
enough, nor numerous enough to relieve
the big house of its vacancy. There were
heavy woollen draperies in the parlor windows,
but not a hint of the pretty white
muslin which a woman would have had up
in no time. Once she passed the house just
at dusk, after the lights were lighted.
Through the long windows she looked
into the empty room. Not so much as a
cat or a dog was awaiting the master. In
the swift glance with which she swept the
interior she noted that the fireplace was
boarded in. That seemed to Di indescribably
dreary. Perhaps her grandfather
did not sit here; perhaps he had a
library somewhere, like their own. But,
no; there was the portly footman entering
with the evening paper, which he laid
upon the table before coming to close the
shutters.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s too old to say he is sorry,&#8221; Di
said to herself, as she turned dejectedly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
away; &#8220;a great deal too old&mdash;and lonely&mdash;and
dreary!&#8221;</p>
<p>And it was on that very evening that
she made her little petition to her mother,
and that her father declared that Di was
sure to bag her game.</p>
<p>Old Mr. Crosby, meanwhile, was too
well-used to his empty house and to his
boarded-in fireplace to mind them very
much, too unaccustomed to muslin curtains
to miss them. Yet he had not been
on very good terms with himself for the
past few weeks, and that was something
which he did mind particularly.</p>
<p>The result of his long cogitation in
front of the grandfather picture had been
highly uncomplimentary to the artist. He
pronounced the homespun subject unworthy
of artistic treatment, and he told
himself that it merited just that order of
criticism which it had received at the
hands of the young person with the rather
pretty turn of countenance, who had regarded
it with such enthusiasm. Nevertheless,
he did not forget the picture,&mdash;nor
yet the young person!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></p>
<p>It was the afternoon of Thanksgiving
day, and there was a light fall of snow
outside. He remembered that in old times
there used always to be a lot of snow on
Thanksgiving day. Things were very
different in old times. He wondered
what would have been thought of a man
fifty years ago,&mdash;or seventeen years ago,
for the matter of that,&mdash;who was giving
his servants a holiday and dining at the
club. As if those foreign servants had
any concern in the Yankee festival! But
then, what concern had he, Horatio
Crosby, in it nowadays? What had he
to be thankful for? Whom had he to be
thankful with? He was very lucky to
have a club to go to! He might as well
go now, though it was still two or three
hours to dinner time. He would ring for
his overcoat and snow-shoes.</p>
<p>His hand was on the bell-rope&mdash;for Mr.
Horatio Crosby was old-fashioned, and
had never yet admitted an electric button
to his domain.</p>
<p>At that moment the door opened softly&mdash;what
was Burns thinking of, not to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
knock?&mdash;and there stood, not Burns, not
Nora, but a slender apparition in petticoats,
with a dash of snow on hat and
jacket, and a dash of daring in a pair of
very bright eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good afternoon, Grandfather,&#8221; was the
apparition&#8217;s cheerful greeting, and involuntarily
the old gentleman found himself
replying with a &#8220;Good afternoon&#8221; of his
own.</p>
<p>The apparition moved swiftly forward,
and, before he knew what he was about,
an unmistakable kiss had got itself applied
to his countenance and&mdash;more amazing
still&mdash;he was strongly of the impression
that there had been&mdash;no robbery!</p>
<p>Greatly agitated by so unusual an experience,
he only managed to say: &#8220;So you
are&#8211;&#8211;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I am Di Crosby,&mdash;your granddaughter,
you know, and&mdash;this is Thanksgiving
day!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say so!&#8221; and the old man
gazed down at her in growing trepidation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s sit down,&#8221; Di suggested, feeling
that she gained every point that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
her adversary lost. &#8220;This must be your
chair. And I&#8217;ll sit here. There! Isn&#8217;t
this cozy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, very!&#8221;</p>
<p>The master of the house had sufficiently
recovered himself to put on his spectacles,
the use of which was affording him much
satisfaction. He really did not know that
the young girl of the day was so pretty!</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose you smoke a pipe,&#8221;
Di remarked, in a strictly conversational
tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, no; I can&#8217;t say I do. Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I only thought I should like to light
one for you. You know,&#8221; she added, confidentially,
&#8220;girls always light their grandfathers&#8217;
pipes in books. And I&#8217;ve had so
little practice in that sort of thing!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In pipes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;in grandfathers!&#8221;</p>
<p>There came a pause, occupied, on Di&#8217;s
part, by a swift, not altogether approving
survey of the stiff, high-studded room.
This time it was the old gentleman who
broke the silence.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 365px;'>
&#8220;&#8216;Good afternoon, Grandfather,&#8217; was the apparition&#8217;s cheerful greeting.&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I believe you are the young lady who
admired that old clodhopper in the picture,&#8221;
he remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; he was a great darling!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He wasn&#8217;t very handsome.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but&mdash;there is always something
so dear about a grandfather!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Always?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; always!&#8221; and suddenly Di left
her seat, and, taking a few steps forward,
she dropped on her knees before him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Grandfather,&#8221; she said, clasping her
small gloved hands on his knee, &#8220;Grandfather!&#8221;</p>
<p>She was meaning to be very eloquent
indeed,&mdash;that is, if it were to become
necessary. She did not dream that that
one word, so persuasively spoken, was
more eloquent than a whole oration.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Miss Di?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Grandfather, I&#8217;ve a great favour to ask
of you, and I should like to have you say
&#8216;yes&#8217; beforehand!&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked down upon her with a heart
rendered surprisingly soft by that first
word,&mdash;and a mind much tickled by the
audacity of the rest of it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And are you in the habit of getting
favours granted in the dark?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Papa says I usually bag my game!&#8221;</p>
<p>Now old Mr. Crosby had been a sportsman
in his day, and he was mightily pleased
with the little jest. But he only asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;And what&#8217;s your game in this instance,
if you please?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I! And you want to bag me?
Bag me for what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For dinner!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, for dinner!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes! We are all by ourselves to-day,
and you&#8217;ll just make the table even.
There&#8217;s only Papa and Mamma, and
Louise, and Beth, and Alice, and the
baby.&#8221; Somehow the succession of sweet,
soft names sounded very attractive to the
crabbed old man.</p>
<p>&#8220;The baby is six years old,&#8221; Di continued,
unconsciously adding another
touch to the attractiveness of the picture.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what is her name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>His</i> name is Horatio. I never liked
it very well; it seemed too long for a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
baby. But, do you know?&mdash;I think I shall
like it better now.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was still kneeling before him, with
her small gloved hands clasped on his
knee. It was clear that she had not the
faintest idea of being refused. Yet even
had she been somewhat less confident, she
might well have taken heart of hope, for,
at this point, he gently laid his wrinkled
hand upon hers.</p>
<p>&#8220;You <i>will</i> come to dinner?&#8221; she begged,
apparently quite unconscious of the little
caress. &#8220;We dine at five on Thanksgiving
day, and you and I can walk over
together. They will all be so surprised,&mdash;and
so happy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then they are not expecting me?&#8221;
and the old man gave her a very piercing
look, which did not seem to pierce at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; they didn&#8217;t know who it was to
be. I only said it was a very important
personage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Coming in a bag!&#8221; he suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s only a sportsman&#8217;s expression!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed! And is it customary nowadays
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
to go a-hunting for your Thanksgiving
dinner?&#8221;</p>
<p>Di&#8217;s eyes danced. This was indeed a
grandfather worth waiting for! But she
only answered demurely:</p>
<p>&#8220;That depends upon your quarry!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucky Di, to have hit upon that pretty,
old-fashioned word! She had, indeed, read
her Sir Walter to good purpose.</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Horatio Crosby had held out
stoutly against every appeal of natural
affection, of reason, of conscience. He
was not a quick-tempered man like his
son; he was not, like his daughter-in-law,
easily rebuffed; but there was about him
a toughness of fibre which yielded neither
to blows nor to pressure, and which, for
many years, neither friend nor foe had
penetrated. And here was this young
thing simply ignoring the hitherto impenetrable
barrier! The clear young eyes
looked straight through it, the fresh young
voice made nothing of it, the playful
fancies overleapt it. A quarry, indeed!
Where had the child got hold of the
word?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span></p>
<p>Of a sudden the old man bent forward
and lightly touched the laughing face in
token of surrender.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an old bird you&#8217;ve winged, little
girl,&#8221; he said, as he rose to his feet
and stepped once more to the bell-rope;
and this time he really rang for his coat and
overshoes.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&#8220;And so you&#8217;ve named this little chap
Horatio?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dinner was over,&mdash;a very pleasant,
natural kind of dinner, too, in spite of the
difficulty some of the family had found
in eating it,&mdash;and they were all gathered
about a roaring woodfire, fortifying themselves,
with the aid of coffee, cigars, and
chocolate-drops,&mdash;each according to his
kind,&mdash;for a game of blind-man&#8217;s-buff.
The small scion of the house was seated
on his grandfather&#8217;s knee, playing with
his grandfather&#8217;s fob, after the immemorial
habit of small scions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course we named him Horatio!&#8221;
It was Mrs. Crosby who answered, and,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
as her father-in-law looked across at her
face with the firelight playing upon it, he
seemed to remember that he had always
wished for a daughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what do you call him for short?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just Horatio!&#8221; piped up little Alice,
who was sitting on the rug at the old
gentleman&#8217;s feet, gently pulling Rollo&#8217;s
long-suffering ears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mr. Thomas Crosby; &#8220;we
have always been proud of the name.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Di, perceiving a slight unsteadiness
in the voice in which this was said,
stepped behind her grandfather&#8217;s chair,
and, dropping a small kiss on the top of
his head, looked across at her father, and
exclaimed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Papa! To think of our having
bagged a grandfather!&#8221;</p>
